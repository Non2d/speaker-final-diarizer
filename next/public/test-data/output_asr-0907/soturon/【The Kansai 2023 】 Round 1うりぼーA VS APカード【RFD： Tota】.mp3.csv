0.0,3.92, Thank you judges. What we think is very important during the pandemic time is
3.92,9.12," helping many people as possible and passing those things. In those circumstances,"
9.12,14.48, these kind of patents will slow the enhancement of development of new drugs
14.48,18.9, or vaccines or the accessibility of those things. So we are
18.9,23.04, very happy to propose this motion. So two things I'm going to talk about in my
23.04,28.96," speech. Firstly, how patents will bother or slow the enhancement of development and"
28.96,30.34, the accessibility of drugs.
30.34,35.84," Secondly, how inner savvy will be set up, which is the counter of the status quo."
35.84,40.88," Before moving on, I'm going to talk about a couple of models or definitions."
40.88,45.48," First, Western Pharmaceutical Company, I, as you know, it's like Pfizer"
45.48,53.56," or Moderna, which has large, large pharmaceutical company with large, you know, money and those"
53.56,61.82," things. And what we mean by the about the release of patents, first of all, the scope"
61.82,65.94," of the patents will be like, you patents will be more like pandemic related."
65.94,68.46, So it is not like all patents.
68.46,72.66," For example, when it is the COVID time, COVID vaccine"
72.66,74.1," or drugs, that will be."
74.1,78.04," And also, in the world where there are patents,"
78.04,80.64," you have to pay fee for using that,"
80.64,86.76," or maybe those kind of companies have to occupy the knowledge, have a right to knowledge."
86.76,88.64," But what we think from the government side,"
88.64,92.96," when there are no patents, it is more open,"
92.96,95.0, those kind of disclosure of the information
95.0,97.86, of the sausage or those kind of things.
97.86,100.54," So moving on to the first argument,"
100.54,102.42," how patents will rather than have a say,"
102.42,110.8," enhancement of the limit and accessibility of drugs. So as a conclusion, I won't say patents will rather than have a say in enhancement of development and accessibility of drugs. So as a conclusion I won't say patents will slow down and lessen accessibility for three"
110.8,118.88," reasons. Firstly, simply when there are patents you cannot get the skill or use that skill because the"
118.88,129.0," corporation doesn't have the incentive to share those knowledge. And secondly, you have to sell tons of money to use that"
129.0,139.56," patent. For example, if you want to use the patent of the company A, company B has to"
139.56,146.6," pay a lot of money, which is unlikely to happen. And thirdly, if there are less types of"
146.6,150.74," medicine and when there are patents, it means"
150.74,155.3," there are less types of medicine. In those circumstances, the prices of"
155.3,160.58, the drug or the vaccine will be higher. So the conclusion here is that
160.58,170.0, patents will slow the development of new drugs and lessen the accessibility of drugs.
170.0,172.0, Why is this problematic? For two reasons.
172.0,186.78," Firstly, when there are pandemics, these poor people cannot access the drug or the vaccine. Maybe in a country like Japan, when there are a lot of money"
186.78,190.72," or a rich country, the government"
190.72,198.78, have the budget to buy through the money to the citizen.
198.78,203.78," But in majority cases, especially in poor countries,"
203.78,207.4, they don't have enough money to do that.
207.4,213.2," So that means in the worst cases, you don't have the right to get the vaccine or get the"
213.2,216.74, drug means that in the past.
216.74,225.0," And secondly, why it's problematic is that it slows the development of the new drugs, right?"
225.52,230.36," For example, maybe company A has made original"
230.36,234.54," COVID-19 vaccine, and company B are very specific"
234.54,238.92," and at the Delta Cup or another cup,"
238.92,241.72," but in the world, you don't have the patent,"
241.72,243.18," you don't have the rights to use the patent,"
243.18,245.3," or the patent is not released later, please."
246.42,251.34," And so, these companies have to do from the scratch, right?"
251.34,257.28," They have to use tons of money, they have to use tons of time to do the clinical trial, those kinds of things, right?"
257.28,259.32," In those circumstances, it will lessen the"
262.82,267.6," development of the new drugs. So why this is important is that when the times of pandemic times,"
267.6,274.7," it is, you know, like, you have to get the drugs or the vaccine"
274.7,276.64, to help many people.
276.98,277.14, Yes.
277.76,280.38," Yes, we can see that helping people is quite important."
280.56,283.48," But even if it is not the situation of the worldwide pandemic,"
283.74,286.8, still there are a lot of patients who are struggling with diseases.
286.8,291.76, Why you can focus on the situation of those kind of worldwide pandemic?
291.76,296.68, Why you can have the right to steal those properties that you recover investing in?
296.68,298.88, My partner will answer this question.
298.88,301.52," So moving on to the second point, how our side is better."
301.52,307.9," What we think is that in the world where patents will be released,"
307.9,317.88," it will fasten the development of the new drugs because for two reasons. Firstly, when"
317.88,325.64," the patent is disclosed, it means that many companies have access to data."
325.64,330.26, More competition will happen and when the world like you know there are no
330.26,338.26, patents you have like many companies have the opportunity to get that
338.26,346.9, information that means that you know company A can use the information company B can't use it.
346.9,351.28, So in that circumstances maybe the in the world there are like you know
351.28,368.68," patents. This Western first company who has a patent will not be feel like making development but like you know because the information all the information is this code, those companies"
368.68,372.18, will be rushed to do another.
372.18,379.82, And second reason why it will be faster in development is that each company can use the
379.82,382.9, Provence skill or Tokui Gunya of that each skill.
382.9,385.4," For example, maybe the company A are good at"
385.4,389.76," designing clinical trial or using digital twins,"
389.76,392.68," like these kind of AI, you know, things,"
392.68,394.8," or maybe company B can use it, right?"
394.8,397.64," In those circumstances, using each company"
397.64,399.6," can use their own skill, which means"
399.6,403.0," development and, you know,"
403.0,405.74," get the skill from the, you know,"
405.74,410.74, and from those original information.
412.34,415.9," So we think because of two reasons,"
415.9,419.3, we think it will be fastening the development
419.3,424.3," and will, the accessibility of the drug will be open."
424.56,425.92," For this reason, I'm happy to propose."
426.06,426.38, Thank you.
429.1,431.22, Thank you very much for that fine speech.
431.38,472.54," I'll now invite the leader of the opposition.お待ちしております Thank you, Chair."
473.4,478.44," Patent rights have proven to be a powerful engine of innovation,"
478.44,485.34, driving progress and fostering unprecedented technological advancement.
490.46,497.3," On this side of the government, unfortunately, disincentivized pharmaceutical corporations not to innovate these kinds of important vaccinations or medications during times of economic."
497.7,501.22," That's why, unfortunately, from the perspective of practical consequences,"
501.82,509.84," the more people will not be able to mitigate it, unfortunately. And in the principle consequences, unfortunately, today's government is unfortunately invading"
509.84,512.88, the important property rights of the patent.
513.76,515.24, I have three things to tell you.
515.66,518.58," Number one, I will explain the counter-model as an opposition."
519.26,524.34," And number two, I will explain the principle argument and why the patent should work as"
524.34,525.88," important property rights and why the patent should work as important property,"
525.88,528.58, and why government shouldn't invade it.
528.58,534.9," And number three, I will talk about today's government, unfortunately, disincentivizing"
534.9,541.16," the medical innovation, and more people are going to die in their power."
541.16,547.82, So let's move on to the first issue about the model.
547.82,554.82," So first of all, I'm going to support the status quo situation, right?"
554.82,559.96, So pharmaceutical corporation still has patent and so the other company wants to use the
559.96,566.24," technology or patent, of course they need to pay to some extent money for the corporation."
566.24,574.08," So number two, and we are very happy to compromise to introduce license fee to obligate that"
574.08,578.82, kind of the Western Pharmaceutical Corporation needs to accept or release to some extent
578.82,583.7, of patent with a significant amount of fee.
583.7,588.0, And even if this fee is unacceptable or sky-high expensive
588.0,590.5," and other corporations are not actually accessible,"
590.98,595.98," we can, of course, adjust the amount of fee to the acceptable one."
596.2,598.8, So this is the best compromise I can do.
599.5,602.4," And more than that, we are, of course, very happy to subsidize"
602.4,606.56, those medical corporations to actually harsh
606.56,610.16, the development of medical medicine or vaccination.
610.16,615.1, We are happy to enhance the investment or lending.
615.1,616.6, So this is our model.
616.6,621.68," So let's move on to the first issue in terms of principle level of the patent, why it has"
621.68,626.54, to work as an important property right. So we need to admit Western
626.54,634.06, Pharmaceutical Company patent as very important as a property right. So forcing the pharmaceutical
634.06,640.58, corporation to release the patent is invasion of their property right. So why is that? Because
640.58,648.28," they actually made a lot of effort for many two reasons. A, of course, they are the only ones who spend so much cost, right?"
648.66,650.08," So they, of course, invest a lot."
650.64,653.1, They develop the machine or mathematical model.
653.66,656.34," They, of course, invest a massive amount of human resources,"
656.92,660.84," hiring outstanding scientists or engineering members and so on,"
661.4,664.94, which is a unique effort that other corporations are not doing.
664.94,665.76, That's why they
665.76,671.6," can reach out to the development and they can get patents. And number two, of course,"
671.6,676.9," they spend so much time to develop this kind of patent, right? And this is not a short-term"
676.9,682.56, effort. They actually use the technology for a long time and they develop this kind of
682.56,685.0, patent with spending so much long-term
685.0,690.38," perspective such as five to ten years or not only just a few months or a few days, right?"
690.38,695.96," So this kind of consistent effort, time and the cost is an important reason."
695.96,703.04, So the result that they develop can actually reach the good innovation such as effective
703.04,706.9," vaccination, such as masks to eliminate molecules of COVID,"
707.3,709.86," such as good medication against the pandemic,"
710.34,713.02," like flu, influenza, or so forth, right?"
713.74,715.9," So those all medical development,"
716.14,718.64," it's all retributed from corporations' effort,"
719.04,722.58," hoping their sustainable profit as a form of patent, right?"
722.94,725.82, So government actually ignore this kind of
725.82,732.78, effort and suddenly set the arbitrary criteria of emergence and this kind of situation is
732.78,736.56," not acceptable. Before moving on any, I have a letter for"
736.56,745.22," you. Okay, let's move on to, so analogy of this, why this is not acceptable, is of course, the first to be,"
745.22,747.52," so even if there's any scarcity,"
747.52,749.58," even if there's any shortage of food,"
749.58,751.26," or on this kind of situation,"
751.26,753.9," of course, government cannot certainly say"
753.9,756.2, they're going to nationalize the food factory
756.2,758.22," or food industry, right?"
758.22,760.72, Even if the AI development is actually raising
760.72,762.52," and probably this unlock,"
762.52,765.94, there are many trouble in the world of course we
765.94,771.28, cannot force a corporation such as GPTO Microsoft to release their patent
771.28,776.14, related industry right so we are not saying that because we admit the
776.14,788.72," importance of property right so let's move on to the second issue about about decentralization of innovation. So, of course, as I said, to develop"
789.82,794.82," these kind of medical products, it costs actually a lot."
795.66,798.02," So like I say, they need to invest a lot"
798.02,800.46, and they need to develop their unique
800.46,803.9, mathematical model or something like this.
803.9,806.38," And also, they are not actually certain"
806.38,809.22, whether or not this kind of medication
809.22,812.12," is actually going to be needed in the future,"
812.12,814.28, because it's very uncertain whether or not
814.28,818.26, the development of the current medicine
818.26,820.58," is going to be effective in the future,"
820.58,823.64, or whether or not actually another pandemic
823.64,825.14, will come in the future.
826.52,827.06, They can also assess that.
831.84,832.24," But as long as there is the patent to create a sustainable money for company,"
835.92,840.44, that's why they have actually massive motivation to keep innovating. To keep innovating and investing these kind of products.
841.46,844.12," So, of course, for example, in the case of pandemic,"
844.62,846.8," of course, vaccine and medicines demand"
846.8,852.76, increase. That's why a lot of corporations want to develop effective products. And if one company
852.76,859.12," developing the outstanding product, of course, other corporations also want to use the patent"
859.12,867.5," to get the technology, and they can also have massive incentive to sophisticate the product with the patent, right? That's why these kind of"
867.5,871.88, patent is actually important key essence to unlock difficulty
871.88,875.68, of innovating medication. What's going to happen in after plan?
876.16,879.62," First of all, of course, there's very few profit for"
879.62,883.66," pharmaceutical corporation. It's not a profitable situation at all,"
884.02,885.28, right? So that's why the
885.28,889.94, research and development fee is going to be cut for this kind of cooperation.
889.94,895.48," That's why the important, for example, the medication against the COVID or flu"
895.48,901.62, is also going to be cut. They're going to probably move to other
901.62,908.22, industry such as just investing on generic medication which can be effective
908.22,911.32, but not critical for the COVID situation.
911.32,920.48," This is to save more people, to preserve principal importance of patent in the future."
920.48,922.06, Thank you very much for that fine speech.
922.06,1009.38," Now I'd like to invite the Deputy Prime Minister. Дякую. All right. Thank you, Jefferson. First, I want to start with the characterization of the large corporations."
1009.38,1014.56," In order to prove without this policy, Marisa's utilization of the patent will happen, and"
1014.56,1019.64, they dominate profit by excluding small corporations or venture corporations who have the potential
1019.64,1028.02," to produce that important medicine or technology as much as possible on their side of the house, which means"
1028.02,1031.78, their counter-proposal is too soft to prevent this policy.
1032.3,1035.7," We see in the status quo, those large corporations strongly"
1035.7,1039.78, exclude the venture corporation or startup corporation on their side of the house.
1040.28,1044.18, We see large corporations try to purchase
1044.18,1049.0, the patent which venture corporations or smaller corporations also have in the status quo.
1049.0,1057.0," Therefore, those new important technologies or knowledge will be dominated by the larger corporations on their side of the house."
1057.0,1066.44," And also we see Evergreen, right? Once their patent will be expired, large corporations try to introduce similar patents in order"
1066.44,1073.0, to perpetuate this unfair social structure for the smaller venture corporations.
1073.0,1079.76," Therefore, as a consequence, those technologies, medicine, will be totally dominated and malicious"
1079.76,1083.24, utilization of the patents will happen on their side of the path.
1083.24,1085.72," Why this is structurally happening is very simple, right?"
1085.72,1088.44," Because corporation, large corporation,"
1088.44,1090.14," are inherently short-sighted,"
1090.14,1091.92, because they have to cater the interest
1091.92,1093.66," of the shareholder's interest,"
1093.66,1098.4," and we see in the case of the breach of the trust, right?"
1098.4,1101.38," We think, look at the case of the British, right?"
1101.38,1104.66, Shareholder can cause lawsuit against a company
1104.66,1105.6, as long as the corporation
1105.6,1113.92, don't take action to maximize their benefit if they don't cater the profit of the shareholder.
1114.72,1120.0, That's why those malicious utilizations strongly happen without this policy under their model.
1121.44,1128.52," Opposition side may say, hey, those corporations have a natural incentive to care about reputation,"
1128.76,1133.56," that's why those might-ass utilization are unlikely to happen, etc."
1133.56,1139.06," But I don't think this is likely, because as I already talked to you, corporations are"
1139.06,1145.12," inherently short-sighted and profit-seeking, therefore,"
1148.02,1150.44," okay, like, so therefore, like,"
1154.0,1155.08," therefore, like, okay, therefore, like,"
1157.22,1158.74, the malicious utilization are likely to happen on their side of the house.
1158.74,1161.48," And also, what we got from side of the position"
1161.48,1166.88," is that under our model, disincentivization to research and"
1166.88,1172.72, development will happen or etc etc but i don't think this is likely in the first place because
1172.72,1180.08, when it comes to the pandemic when it comes to the pharmacy obviously large demand strongly exists
1180.08,1190.4, right in the case of the kobe 19 like many people try to vaccinate or utilize medicine again and
1190.4,1196.24," again. For example, in Japan, at least three times those people have to utilize. Therefore,"
1196.8,1203.28," even if large corporations lose the patent, anyway those corporations have a natural incentive to"
1203.28,1206.0," enter the industry of the pharmacy, as they have a natural incentive to enter the industry of the pharmacy,"
1206.0,1211.0, as they have a natural incentive to commit the research and the development to big events.
1211.0,1215.0," And secondly, especially when it comes to pharmacy,"
1215.0,1222.0," their products directly connecting to the reputation, increasing reputation,"
1222.0,1228.0," because their products directly connecting, saving life, saving precious life."
1228.0,1236.0," Therefore, if their knowledge of technology will be compromised because of this policy,"
1236.0,1242.0, still those corporations have a natural incentive to enter their industry to begin with.
1242.0,1247.0," And also, we tell you, disincentivization"
1247.0,1249.08," rather happen on their side of the house,"
1249.08,1251.56," because as I already talked to you,"
1251.56,1256.56, many of the technology or medicine
1257.8,1261.32," will be totally dominated by the large corporation, right?"
1261.32,1264.42," Once venture corporation or small corporation,"
1264.42,1265.28," even small corporation, venture corporation try venture corporations or small corporations, even small"
1265.28,1269.6," corporations or venture corporations try to opt into that industry, their knowledge,"
1269.6,1273.2, their technology are totally dominated by the multinational corporations.
1273.2,1279.36," Therefore, those, like, relatively, like, those corporations who have less financial"
1279.36,1287.66," capacity lose incentive to, like, enter this industry more and more on their side of the"
1287.66,1288.92," house. But before that, yes."
1289.5,1293.62," I understand to some extent there is a huge demand on medication during the pandemic,"
1294.0,1299.24, right? But by releasing patent and thousands of companies actually started selling the
1299.24,1304.06," same products, which is not actually profitable, how still your side of pharmaceutical"
1304.06,1306.5, cooperation has massive incentive for innovation?
1307.56,1308.08," Obviously,"
1308.44,1310.3, even if patents will be disclosed
1310.3,1311.06," to the public,"
1311.8,1314.28, as my partner already
1314.28,1316.2," talked to you, each corporation"
1316.2,1318.24," have their own strong point,"
1318.24,1319.0," for example,"
1319.28,1322.58, corporation A
1322.58,1323.86, has a specific knowledge
1323.86,1326.92," A, corporation B has a specific knowledge A, corporation B has a specific"
1326.92,1335.36," knowledge of B, etc. Therefore, yes, we concede an important basis of the medicine, or important"
1335.36,1345.52," basis of the technology shared by every single corporation, however, those another"
1345.52,1353.62, corporation can give additional benefit or
1353.62,1365.76," additional functional idea of the technology or medicine or those kind of things. Therefore, by doing so, each corporation"
1365.76,1369.02," easily differentiate each other,"
1369.02,1373.88," therefore those corporations can still have the incentive,"
1373.88,1376.52, those corporations still can gain the benefit
1376.52,1378.74, under our side of the house.
1378.74,1383.74," And also we think, what we got from their side of the house,"
1383.92,1387.6, like the invasion of the right of the corporation.
1387.6,1395.0," But I think, as Mike already talked to you, when it comes to the pandemic, especially"
1395.0,1408.76," many citizens dying right now, the right of the corporation should be compromised in order to maximize the potential of the corporation to begin with."
1408.76,1415.88," Because as my old lady talked to you, those corporations are strongly blocked by the large"
1415.88,1418.24, corporations in the status quo.
1418.24,1425.48," Therefore, in terms of corporate social responsibility, I think their rights should be compromised to begin with."
1425.48,1428.56," Therefore, we think the effect to propose."
1428.56,1473.8," Thank you very much for that speech. Okay. Okay, existence of the patent is a really activated competition we believe, which is"
1473.8,1478.86, turned by business to continually improve their products and services.
1478.86,1484.14, This is actually giving the benefit to the consumer and the society as a whole.
1484.14,1487.0, That is what we are happy to support this motion.
1487.0,1489.0," So, before moving on to my substantive,"
1489.0,1493.0, let me quickly back to what the previous speaker said.
1493.0,1496.0," So, first of all, he said that venture companies"
1496.0,1504.0, do not take direct action to invest or develop new technology or something like that.
1504.0,1507.0," We don't think so, even current situation."
1507.0,1510.72, A lot of the venture companies can take the inaction.
1510.72,1513.28," For example, let me take the example,"
1513.28,1516.16, the case of the COVID-19.
1516.16,1519.84, So Moderna is actually a venture company.
1519.84,1524.84, This is a bill that like after 2010.
1529.62,1536.68, And of course we already know they do not have so enough the monetary capacity but if they can invest enough beautiful technology they can
1536.68,1543.76, invest it by a lot of the investor from the whole of society and they can earn money from
1543.76,1547.38," the society, right? That is, we think even in a part of this house,"
1547.38,1552.22, enough technology is actually made by those kind of company.
1552.22,1554.5," Or second of all, he said that the company"
1554.5,1556.34, just take the short-term benefit.
1556.34,1557.86, We don't think so also.
1557.86,1561.48, So because those kind of company also invest
1561.48,1563.58," from a lot of people, at the moment,"
1563.58,1565.38, if they just focus on the short-term
1565.38,1571.04," benefit from the society, but on the other hand they also have to consider about the"
1571.04,1576.86," long-term benefit, for example, utilizing their patent or continuously selling the new"
1576.86,1578.64," product to the society, right?"
1578.64,1586.0," So that's why we think such kind of malicious usage of the patent is less likely to happen like they say that, right?"
1586.0,1601.3," Because if they maliciously make tons of the fee, so many expensive fee to just use such kind of patent technology,"
1601.3,1604.1," so of course no one do not want to use it, right?"
1604.1,1608.0," In the first place, that is why we don't think that kind of situation is actually happening."
1608.0,1612.0," Okay, next moving on to my substantive."
1612.0,1616.0," First of all, so why releasing"
1616.0,1620.0, the patent is completely under my motivation to develop new technology
1620.0,1624.0, and unfortunately the existence of information itself
1624.0,1628.0, is obviously declining in that part of the system.
1628.0,1642.0," Or secondly, the property rights, why we should not betray the arbitrary steal such kind of property rights"
1642.0,1647.0," from the entire company, even that case of the pandemic cases."
1647.0,1650.0," So, lastly, let me compare each paradigm."
1650.0,1659.0," First of all, why releasing the patent is completely under my motivation to develop a new technology."
1659.0,1667.1," So, in that fact, the company has two choices. If you develop new technology, first of all,"
1667.1,1670.92, you can share such kind of information
1670.92,1673.16, as a patent to the whole global society.
1673.16,1676.38," Actually, we can know how to make it,"
1676.38,1679.24, what kind of substances actually in such kind of drug
1679.24,1680.18, or something like that.
1680.18,1681.88," But if you try to use it,"
1681.88,1684.44," such kind of technology or information itself,"
1684.44,1689.6," at the moment, they have to pay the money or something like that."
1689.6,1690.96, This is the case of the one.
1690.96,1696.8," The second of all, they still have the choice to hinder such kind of information itself to the society"
1696.8,1700.64, because they do not want to share information to the society.
1700.64,1705.0," Even this is the deal with,'s dealt with as a patent,"
1707.72,1710.48," still in our society, the output of the company"
1710.48,1714.4, just has tried to hinder such kind of mechanism
1714.4,1715.24, or something like that.
1715.24,1717.1," For example, as my partner already mentioned that,"
1717.1,1719.82," such kind of chart, DTPD, or algorithm,"
1719.82,1723.36, it's actually hindered even in the current situation.
1723.36,1726.24," In their part of this house, there is no evidence at all"
1726.24,1728.3, of the situation why such kind of company
1728.3,1730.86," has the motivation to share information,"
1730.86,1733.26, how to make it those kind of drug itself.
1733.26,1735.48," In our society, there is no mechanism"
1735.48,1738.6, from the entire government side.
1738.6,1742.4," That is why in the first place, they cannot recover"
1742.4,1747.12," such kind of investigation, as my partner already mentioned that, or more"
1747.12,1753.36," than that, so rather we believe they try to hinder those kind of new technology, the method to make"
1753.36,1766.32," new products, they try to hinder and just maliciously utilize those kind of methods to earn money right so that's why we think this is a completely problematic"
1766.32,1775.2, okay let's next move on to the second substantive so why uh we think that stealing that
1776.56,1786.24," okay the stealing the property uh shouldn't be traded even in the any. As my point of information mentioned that,"
1786.24,1789.68," so even if it is the situation of the world water pandemic,"
1789.68,1792.3," even not situation of the world water pandemic,"
1792.3,1795.72," still we can find a lot of the people,"
1795.72,1798.98, the patients who are actually struggling
1798.98,1800.38, with any kind of diseases.
1800.38,1802.6," In that case of the urgency,"
1802.6,1804.94," so of course we have to tackle,"
1804.94,1809.96," we have to solve those kinds of patients, even if it's not the case of the world-wide pandemic."
1810.32,1827.3," But unfortunately, they arbitrarily decide a line to distinguish which person should be helped in the case of the global pandemic, right? We don't think those kinds of situations can be"
1829.18,1833.76," trade. Why is that? So because in our part of this has, so"
1834.24,1839.7, because in existence of a patent actually activate new technology or the
1840.44,1843.66, method to the first places. That will be seen. This is
1844.36,1847.28, should be message in the first place. That is what we think. This is a special thing.
1847.28,1853.1," So let me compare the two perspectives. First of all, about the motivation."
1853.1,1857.84," Even in the short term or long term, we think our side is outweighed because as my"
1857.84,1862.56," partner already mentioned that even if this is existence or patent, still a lot"
1862.56,1865.68," of the company can utilize those kinds of methods itself,"
1865.68,1870.8," more than that, companies themselves have the motivation to recover a lot of investigations,"
1870.8,1876.08," but in their part of this house, they try to hinder such kind of information, or more than that,"
1876.08,1887.0, they try to replace other kinds of investigations not related to such kind a pandemic or a crucial disease in the worldwide cases.
1887.0,1895.0," So, lastly, we shouldn't decide arbitrarily what kind of disease should be solved or something"
1895.0,1896.0, like that.
1896.0,1905.1, So that's what we're happy to about. Thank you very much for that
1905.1,1906.22, very fine speech.
1906.54,1960.26," I'd like to invite the Governor to look. Mm. Thank you, Chair."
1960.92,1965.68," We find a big contradiction from the other side of the house, right? Because they"
1965.68,1972.86," said, so they never explained how to adjust. They said in their counter model, they will"
1972.86,1977.3, adjust the patent or something like that. But how they decide the price or something
1977.3,1992.62," like that is completely unclear. And that's why we think the delta of this space is very big due to their yeah, their explanation. And we think, if we think of the, so we say, we think the motivation itself"
1992.62,1998.44," that this, we think we, as my partner will tell you, there are lot of"
1999.28,2005.76, alternative incentive for that kind of cooperation and even if this incentivization to some extent
2005.76,2012.2," happens, we think still the benefit, even if we think still, the incentive of cooperation"
2012.2,2017.5," will remain, and that's why we think the development of the our paradigm explanation is much, much"
2017.5,2018.5, better.
2018.5,2025.04," I'm going to talk about two issues. Firstly, let me talk about motivation. Secondly, let me talk about the preschool model, etc."
2028.28,2030.52," But before that, let me talk about... So the DLO tried to say,"
2030.8,2035.18, they asked why only during the pandemic or something like that.
2035.46,2037.34, But let me talk about what is the difference
2037.34,2040.44," between the normal situation and the pandemic is very clear, right?"
2040.68,2044.24," Because that is very short term, and it suddenly happens, right?"
2044.66,2045.76," So in normal situations, we can use, for example, the, and it suddenly happens, right? So in normal"
2045.76,2050.26," situation, we can use, for example, the genetic medicine, for example, can be available, and"
2050.26,2055.18," it is available, right? So in several cases, and that's why we have a lot of own parties."
2055.5,2060.84," But in emergency cases, in pandemic cases, we don't have any time to wait for genetic,"
2060.98,2066.64," for example, for that kind of thing, right? We think, because that is, especially in the emergency cases,"
2066.64,2070.0," we think we should open a release, that kind of problem."
2070.0,2070.8, You understand?
2070.8,2072.0, More on that later.
2072.0,2073.0," Later, please."
2073.0,2076.0," Yeah, let me talk about motivation."
2076.0,2079.0," They said, we can share the patent."
2079.0,2084.0," So as I pointed out, their counterfactual is very vague in this process, right?"
2084.0,2089.5," Because they said, they have the choice, corporations still have the choice to handle that kind of thing,"
2089.5,2094.0," but at the same time they say that they will force the adjuster according to their model, right?"
2094.0,2100.0," We think, if we think of how they adjust the prices of opening their patents, for example,"
2100.0,2104.0," is that, yeah, probably they're going to be the pressurization by the society, for example,"
2104.0,2107.8," yeah, you should do that because you are the big corporation, you owe it, that is kind"
2107.8,2112.82," of CSR, or that kind of thing, right? And also, probably they will, I say, also, if"
2112.82,2116.9," we think of the incentive of the government, who will restrict, or who will adjust the"
2116.9,2121.16," prices of patents, etc., etc., probably they will cater to the population, right? Because"
2121.16,2126.68," if the population, or the, yeah, situation in situation in society will think about, we need the vaccination,"
2126.68,2128.0, because that is very important.
2128.0,2130.1," It should be open, or that kind of thing."
2130.1,2131.72, But we give it to the population.
2131.72,2135.24," That means that even in their problem,"
2135.24,2138.88, so their argument is completely not mutually exclusive
2138.88,2139.76, to some extent.
2139.76,2146.5," And moreover, we think, so, and notice that they said, Moreover, within..."
2148.7,2149.8," And notice that they said, how do you say it?"
2149.8,2151.32," Yeah, yes, we have to share,"
2151.32,2153.98," but the sharing the information itself means that,"
2153.98,2157.42," not only means that you have to share your own information,"
2157.42,2158.52," but at the same time,"
2158.52,2161.66," you can use other corporation information, right?"
2161.66,2164.38, That brings us the very good development
2164.38,2167.0," of the partner, very telling, right? That brings us the very good development of the partner, right?"
2167.0,2173.0," Then, the real position tries to say that this incentivization will happen, but"
2173.0,2177.0," they're going to steal the benefits, right? For example, the reputation is going to be improved"
2177.0,2188.48," if they can make the first vaccination to the COVID, right? They talk about the case of the model now for example right so if that is true"
2188.48,2193.84, even if they do not have the patent to some extent making the backness in itself the fact itself is
2193.84,2200.32, enough fact for to prove the power of moderna for example the certain corporations i will take later
2200.32,2208.98," and that means that instant investors anyway have the incentive to do that because they have the power to make such kind of wonderful vaccination, for example."
2209.26,2213.92," In that kind of moment, we think still they're going to be the benefit for the corporation."
2215.92,2225.06," With or without pandemic, every single medical product to some extent save life and some are critical for some people. Do you also think pharmaceutical corporations"
2225.06,2227.28, should release other types of medical patents
2227.28,2230.3, such as medical medicine for diabetes or cancer?
2231.24,2232.08," It depends, right?"
2232.08,2234.76," Because they, firstly, that is not which are exclusive"
2234.76,2237.12, because how they try to deal with that kind of problem
2237.12,2239.38," is a very happy and positive, but moreover,"
2239.38,2242.26," we think that, so they also said, adjust, right?"
2242.26,2243.1, It is the same thing.
2243.1,2246.54," So we will, we have to think about the benefit of the cooperation,"
2246.8,2248.2, but also the situation in society.
2248.44,2249.82, We have to balance out that kind of thing.
2250.14,2252.58," And we think, balancing out, if we think of that kind of thing,"
2252.96,2254.84," we think, yeah, in this pandemic case,"
2255.04,2256.82, we should release that kind of product.
2257.36,2258.02, That is better.
2258.46,2260.34," Then they also tried to talk about,"
2261.02,2262.26," so they are going to be,"
2263.02,2264.42," that is very unclear,"
2264.6,2265.3, whether they're going to be the necessity is very unclear that whether they're going
2265.3,2270.6," to be the necessity to that kind of medicine, for example, etc. That's why they're going"
2270.6,2274.86," to refrain from making it, that kind of thing, right? But because, for example, as my partner"
2274.86,2279.64," also told you, because they have the connection with government, right? They are very known"
2279.64,2283.32," about the lobbying, for example, in America, for that kind of thing, right? In that kind"
2283.32,2289.28," of movement, that is the reason why we have to the japanese government is requiring three times the vaccination in japan"
2290.16,2295.68, in that kind of movement we think they can maintain the necessity of their uh development
2295.68,2300.48, or that kind of thing that means that they still have the incentive to do that and also notice that
2300.48,2307.8," they are going to be the pressurization by the society, right? Because you dominate a lot of the information, you dominate a lot of the patent, etc., etc.,"
2307.8,2311.86, then they're going to pressurize you. Why don't you do that?
2312.58,2315.74," The conclusion here is, even if this incentivization"
2315.74,2319.78," is to some extent true, still, they are going to be the benefit for"
2319.78,2323.18," starting their corporation, and once they"
2323.18,2327.44," make new medicine, and release the patent,"
2327.44,2330.56," as my partner told you, there are no restrictions from their side of the house,"
2330.56,2336.72," that's development advanced. For example, because of the competition within the corporation,"
2336.72,2341.44," for example, they try to make the vaccination with lighters, side effects, whatever,"
2341.44,2344.0, that kind of thing can easily happen.
2344.0,2350.96," Then let me talk about principle. Firstly, the principle is very general to some extent, right? Because they just talk about"
2350.96,2354.8," how pattern is important, but they never ever explain why that is unique to the pandemic"
2354.8,2360.72," case in the first place, right? But moreover, secondly, they based on the exploit, so moreover,"
2360.72,2368.48," we can mitigate damage of that kind of thing that they try to talk about, because not all patents are going to be released in our paradigm. And my partner is really telling you a model"
2368.48,2374.0," just that is related to the pandemic cases, right? In that kind of movement, their case,"
2374.0,2379.6," principal case, is also not unique in the first place and not important in this way. So for these"
2379.6,2385.76," reasons, we think that we can, yeah, we can, in the pandemic cases, we can save more people"
2385.76,2386.64, in our paradigm.
2386.94,2388.06, That's why we propose.
2390.68,2393.02, Thank you very much for that fine speech.
2393.02,2431.94, Now I think I'll keep up the show. Дякую. Three things in summation.
2431.94,2436.24," Firstly, the principal issue, utilitarianism versus the property rights."
2436.24,2439.3," And secondly, the incentive of cooperation in status quo."
2439.3,2442.38," And thirdly, the incentive of cooperation after plan adoption."
2442.38,2443.38, So let's start.
2443.38,2447.74," Firstly, in terms of the principal issues. You may agree that general importance of property rights"
2447.74,2451.4, which we already explained to you because that patent right is simply the
2451.4,2454.52, fruit of investment of research and development of pharmaceutical
2454.52,2457.94, corporations and therefore this is guaranteed as a property right.
2457.94,2461.68, This is nothing different from the buying the land while
2461.68,2465.2, constructing the factory by investing the money.
2465.2,2467.54, We think that there is no difference between property right
2467.54,2472.38, and the intellectual property right.
2472.38,2474.28," And actually in the many country,"
2474.28,2476.08," the patent law explain,"
2476.08,2480.72, descript that patent right is one of the property right.
2480.72,2482.52," That's why we think this is in general,"
2482.52,2483.8, this is particularly important.
2483.8,2489.62," And what we already proven to you in this debate is that this is not acceptable, even in the"
2489.62,2494.9," context of the emergency cases, that this is the depriver of property rights is unacceptable."
2495.42,2501.12," Their only claim is that if the emergent cases, that this is acceptable. If this is true, for"
2501.12,2505.06," example, that if the factory exists, which can produce the vaccine,"
2511.4,2516.88," we can buy this kind of factory regardless of their consent of the corporation and possibly produce the vaccine. Or if the land exists, in this case, which is suitable for producing the vaccine,"
2517.14,2521.3," that we can possibly produce, constructing the factory and produce the medicine."
2521.62,2528.78," Or that we can possibly work the doctors or scientists in order to tackle down the COVID-19, for example."
2529.1,2533.18, We think that as long as they fail to explain to what extent the property rights or the
2533.18,2538.46, rights of the individual or rights of the corporation can be infringed under the name
2538.46,2542.36," of the arbitrary criteria of emergency, we think their case must fail."
2542.6,2545.96," Therefore, we think the general principle of the property right is particularly important."
2545.96,2552.14," And more than that, the arbitrariness of this kind of emergency in terms of focusing on"
2552.14,2555.38, the medical patent is particularly unjust.
2555.38,2560.24," They mentioned that in the emergent cases, there is no alternative not to this kind of"
2560.24,2561.24, utilizing patent.
2561.24,2566.14," Firstly, if you look at even just in Japan, the Moderna,"
2566.52,2568.1," Pfizer, KM Bio,"
2568.3,2570.24," Novavax, and so on and so forth, there's lots of"
2570.24,2571.92, alternatives to this. In the worldwide
2571.92,2573.62," cases, for example, Chinese vaccine"
2573.62,2575.92," cooperation exists, we think alternative"
2575.92,2577.72, doing this. That's why there's
2577.72,2580.06," no strong necessity, as they mentioned"
2580.06,2581.0," that. And secondly,"
2581.42,2584.0," in the ordinary cases, if"
2584.0,2586.56," one corporation, for example, invests a wonderful"
2586.56,2592.88," anti-cancer drug, in this case, for the cancer patient, there's no alternative for 20 years,"
2592.88,2597.74," but nothing from this kind of wonderful corporation. Therefore, we see that emergency"
2597.74,2606.98," is not so constitutional a component of this kind of established, tackled down the importance of property rights."
2606.98,2609.38," Therefore, we see utilitarianism cannot trickle down"
2609.38,2611.4," the property rights, that's why we are very proud"
2611.4,2613.94, to oppose this motion.
2613.94,2615.88," So let's move on, based on this kind of principle,"
2615.88,2618.24, let's move on to the practical issues in terms of
2618.24,2620.52, incentive of the corporation in the status quo.
2620.52,2624.9," There's several reasons why the country, the corporation,"
2624.9,2627.38, have the no incentive to spread
2627.38,2628.38, the vaccine.
2628.38,2632.12," Firstly, the very simple question is very factual."
2632.12,2637.62," Actually, in the worldwide, vaccine is spread as a result of the kindness of the corporation."
2637.62,2640.36, This is very simple proof that their case must fail.
2640.36,2650.24," And on the more logical and debatable level, they mentioned that this is short-sighted. We think the vaccination is not only the spread in terms of vaccination is not only the short-term"
2650.24,2657.12," profit, but also that their KPI includes the reputation risk in terms of their own property,"
2657.12,2661.84," because the ESG is particularly important criteria in the current investment criteria. Therefore,"
2661.84,2668.82," they are more careful about the reputation risk in the first place. That's why not only just profit by selling the vaccine,"
2668.82,2671.76, but also the prevalence rate in the population
2671.76,2674.82, is also the important KPI for the management
2674.82,2676.64, of the pharmaceutical corporation.
2676.64,2678.48," Therefore, they are an analysis of short-sightedness"
2678.48,2679.32, is paid.
2679.32,2681.94," And they also mentioned that knowledge share will be failed,"
2681.94,2686.96," but if you take a look at the very basic of the patent,"
2687.0,2690.0, because I actually offer the similar patent
2690.0,2692.68, and I have similar patent after entering
2692.68,2694.24," chemical corporations,"
2694.24,2697.34," firstly, after sending the patent to the office,"
2697.34,2702.18," and 1.5 years after, the patent information is opened"
2702.18,2703.72, to all over the world.
2703.72,2705.52," And after the request of the examination,"
2705.74,2707.66, the patent office examines the newness
2707.66,2709.76," and technological advancement of patents,"
2709.82,2711.3, and patents will be registered.
2711.48,2713.52, This is the very basic knowledge of the patent.
2713.9,2717.56, We think that's why after the corporation decides
2717.56,2721.08," to open the patent to get the patent right,"
2721.08,2722.8, their knowledge will be shared.
2722.92,2729.88, That's why there are some specific features of the corporation can be shared as worldwide knowledge in our paradigm. We
2729.88,2734.24," think this is nothing proven in the first place. They also mentioned evergreen. Again,"
2734.46,2738.22," we think that evergreen is difficult, particularly in a more competitive field, because there"
2738.22,2742.54," is necessity in terms of technological advancement, not only newness. That's why just a similar"
2742.54,2748.56," patent cannot be guaranteed as right, because they are rejected as this is now not technological advancement, just that the gap"
2748.56,2753.68," is not technologically advanced, therefore their case must fail. In terms of the incentive of the"
2753.68,2758.08," corporation, we see this is fine, and in terms of if the corporation has the motivation to"
2758.08,2763.44," build a factory or the ODM the factory and they sell the vaccine, this is fine, and if licensing"
2763.44,2765.52," is necessary, we see this is also fine."
2765.52,2771.84," For those two main ways of their own production and their licensing, we can guarantee"
2771.84,2776.16," actually in the status quo, we can guarantee the number of vaccines, a number of drugs,"
2776.16,2781.2," we think this is there's no problem at all. So sadly, finally, we incentivize the corporation after production."
2781.2,2790.24," We think the incentive of the corporation ended from two perspectives. Firstly, as the leader of the corporation mentioned, they stopped investing in the research and development"
2790.24,2796.76," because simply the pharmaceutical corporation's R&D ratio is very, very high."
2796.76,2806.76," That's why tremendous pressure is necessary. But if they sell the patent at some point of time of the pandemic, this profit is particularly"
2806.76,2807.18, limited.
2807.48,2813.46," But if they continue, for example, in the half a year vaccination for this mandate is"
2813.46,2819.44," recommended in Japan, in this case, their benefit will be skyrocketing compared to the"
2819.44,2822.58, selling at a certain time of the pandemic.
2822.96,2826.78, That's why this kind of incentive comparison is particularly significant for that corporation.
2826.92,2828.06," Therefore, they stop investing."
2828.48,2832.54," And if they still continue investing in the R&D situation,"
2832.54,2836.22, if this kind of precedence of possibly selling
2836.22,2838.4," or possibly buying of the patent exists,"
2838.6,2839.56," in this particular occasion,"
2839.7,2841.58, they stop opening that information.
2841.82,2843.38, They stop registering the patent.
2843.64,2846.5," Instead of that, they hinder the process"
2846.5,2848.54, as a know-how of their own corporation.
2848.54,2850.78, They use knowledge sharing as they mentioned
2850.78,2852.52," that is never, ever achieved."
2852.52,2855.38," Therefore, even if the Italian benefit outside of this area,"
2855.38,2857.62, therefore we are very proud to oppose.
2867.92,2868.14, Thank you very much for that fine speech.
2870.28,2870.38," Now, as to the reply portion of this debate,"
2926.24,2931.46," I'd like to first invite the officer on the line. Дякую. I'm going to talk about two issues, I reply speaker. Number one, I will deeply examine the practical consequences which can actually save more"
2931.46,2936.5, people by encouragement of the medical innovation.
2936.5,2939.24," Second of all, I will look at the principle argument."
2939.24,2942.04, Is that actually patent as property right?
2942.04,2946.6, Can be compromised in this specific occasion as government say or still
2946.6,2950.96, we need to preserve it so let's move on to the first issue about the practical consequences
2950.96,2958.7, so actually that's so let's move on the important question that's actually government side of
2958.7,2967.14, pharmaceutical corporation still have motivation for keep investing in the research and development of the medical sphere.
2967.76,2974.02," So we are seeing as an opposition, the patent is critically important to create sustainable money,"
2974.42,2978.76, which can be paid off by their important research development fee.
2979.34,2981.86," So on this point, government says mainly three things."
2982.12,2985.78," Number one, so opposition stance also kills"
2985.78,2987.56," medical motivations, right?"
2987.94,2990.08," Because we are also, sometimes"
2990.08,2991.78," it's necessary, we also"
2991.78,2993.9, obligatory introduce license
2993.9,2995.92, system to avoid the dominance
2995.92,2997.82," and fee, which is actually"
2997.82,2999.32, adjusted by government side.
3000.0,3002.02, But we are saying from opposition
3002.02,3003.74, this stance is the best
3003.74,3006.78, compromise to be able to coexist
3006.78,3013.2, the medical corporation's motivations and also property rights or the patent rights.
3013.2,3019.72," And also, government is actually not decide the unacceptably extremely cheaper price."
3019.72,3025.58, So government is of course the how much is actually acceptable by looking into the cost
3025.58,3030.28, that pharmaceutical corporation invest on and of course they would like to consider
3030.28,3035.26, the benefit from this patent. That's why the price isn't extremely low and it's going to
3035.26,3041.84, be adjusted. This is the nuance of adjusted price. That's why the steel pharmaceutical
3041.84,3045.1, corporation have massive incentive to keep investing.
3054.78,3055.06," And also, they say, even in the consequences, without a patent, still this kind of vaccination is needed and demand is high."
3059.74,3060.22," That's why those corporations still have motivation to keep innovating, right?"
3066.22,3071.28," But the price is completely different from just selling one shot of vaccination or medication, which can be priced at 1000 yen or something like that, versus the patent, which can be"
3071.28,3074.58, sold for a million yen to a specific corporation.
3074.58,3080.8, And we think this million yen is a very important price for these kinds of pharmaceutical corporations.
3080.8,3106.1," So to be able to pay off their cost, which is actually very expensive, hiring important scientists or engineering teams, or investing in their machine or mathematical model. some extent of the very seemingly extensive for public people, it's still accessible if other"
3106.1,3113.3," pharmaceutical corporation has massive incentive to take advantage of the patent, right? And other"
3113.3,3120.96," point they say that many corporation is going to, other thing we like to say, other corporation is,"
3121.26,3126.18," of course, going to take a free ride, this kind of patent, and this kind of"
3126.18,3129.44," market is going to be certainly in the red ocean, right?"
3129.44,3135.04," That's why usually the free riding is of course cheaper in terms of cost of performance, and"
3135.04,3139.48, no other pharmaceutical corporation has the first winner.
3139.48,3143.68," So that's why in terms of motivation, unfortunately their side cannot win."
3143.68,3146.96, So moving on to the principle case.
3146.96,3150.36," So first of all, unfortunately they never ever cut"
3150.36,3152.94, the principle importance of fundamental patent
3152.94,3155.4, as property right in the first places.
3155.4,3158.44, And they're just saying this is kind of emergency situation.
3158.44,3162.8, But things like emergency does not justify every single act
3162.8,3166.54, to limit the human right and also
3166.54,3170.82," corporation right, as Takaesan said. That's why in the case of general"
3170.82,3175.0," principle level, we also win. That's why we shouldn't allow government"
3175.0,3176.9, aggressive stance. Thank you very much.
3180.98,3183.38, Thank you very much for that fine speech.
3183.7,3246.36," Finally, I would like to invite the Governor of the Parliament. Дякую.はい Thank you, Jefferson."
3246.36,3248.76, They lose this weight for two reasons.
3248.76,3252.32," First, contradictory stance from their side of the house."
3252.32,3256.24," What we got from their side of the house, like invasion of the property, or et cetera,"
3256.24,3261.5," et cetera, but on the other hand, they say they are happy to make property fee low to"
3261.5,3267.16," guarantee accessibility, et cetera, et cetera. I don't think which,"
3267.16,3270.3," to what extent property rights should be respected,"
3270.3,3275.3, because of their contradictory stance to begin with.
3275.3,3279.88," Second, they didn't explain under their counterfactual"
3279.88,3282.46, how domination and the delay of the research
3282.46,3284.9, and the development can be possible
3284.9,3285.32, on their side of the house. What we got from their side of the research and development can be possible on their side
3285.32,3286.32, of the house.
3286.32,3290.16," What we got from their side of the house, well, some venture corporations like Moderna"
3290.16,3292.6," actually succeeded, etc. etc."
3292.6,3298.12," But what they tried to do is just pick up useful case for, comfortable case for government"
3298.12,3300.12, opposition bench to begin with.
3300.12,3305.3," They didn't explain in any logic how the relatively vulnerable corporation,"
3305.66,3310.28," like the venture corporation, can override the domination by the large corporation,"
3310.28,3316.22, which government side constantly indicated from the very beginning.
3317.14,3318.72, But let's look at their case.
3319.48,3323.58," What we got from their side of the house is that invasion of the property, right?"
3323.84,3332.08, Like the opposition side tried to say well like a government side didn't explain to what extent corporation rights should
3332.08,3345.0," be compromised even in emergency cases etc etc but that case like that that indication can be said for government side as well,"
3345.0,3350.0, because opposition side in general try to say
3350.12,3351.68," property rights should be protected,"
3351.68,3352.52," or et cetera, et cetera,"
3352.52,3356.04, but they also didn't explain to what extent
3356.04,3360.4," like a patent in emergency case in this motion,"
3360.4,3362.48, particularly important as well.
3362.48,3366.3, That's why this claim is not mutually exclusive.
3366.3,3372.7," Yes, we can see the government side didn't do well, but on the other hand, the opposition side also didn't do well."
3372.7,3379.6," Therefore, that cannot be the metric to choose which side we think. And also, their arguments are"
3379.6,3387.7," completely example-based to begin with, analogy-based to begin with, analogy based to begin with, because maybe like a"
3387.7,3392.24," opposition would give us logic, but it's too late."
3393.18,3400.46," And also, I think, but we think the main line from government side is that, well, whether"
3400.46,3405.38, or not this motion is incentivized it is in 10 to five corporations
3405.38,3407.8," to commit to research and development,"
3407.8,3409.6," well, et cetera, et cetera."
3409.6,3412.72," But as we already talked to you,"
3412.72,3416.68," there are, as we already talked to you,"
3416.68,3418.16, like a disincentivization
3418.16,3420.86, are less likely to happen for several reasons.
3420.86,3424.84," One, this industry have a huge demand to the humans."
3424.84,3433.0," Second of all, committing this industry has a huge demand to the U.S. Second of all, committing this industry will contribute to improving the corporation's reputation"
3433.0,3436.0, because it's directly connecting saving precious lives.
3436.0,3450.94," And third, yes, we can see that corporations have to give their own information to public, but on the other hand, that corporation also utilizes the information of the other corporation as well."
3450.94,3454.24," That's why disincentivization is less likely to happen,"
3454.24,3467.82," but we didn't hear a strong reputation from their side, the White House. Therefore, we think this motion should be judged"
3467.82,3470.22," in terms of a practical manner,"
3470.22,3474.5, whether or not the profits of the corporation
3474.5,3479.5, are suddenly devastated by taking this motion to the limit.
3480.18,3484.22," But, governments have strongly told you"
3484.22,3486.8," this incentivization is less likely to happen,"
3486.8,3492.24," and because of this motion, competition and research and development will be faster as"
3492.24,3500.96," a consequence. We can save the people as much as possible, therefore we make it a good one."
3500.96,3507.12," Okay, thank you very much for the debate. I'm just going to firstly give the call and then justify the result."
3507.9,3515.28," I think this was a pretty good debate, one that was relatively close, but the winning team was the opposition side."
3515.9,3519.56, And I looked at two questions in deciding the outcome.
3519.56,3530.28, The first question is whether or not this is an acceptable invasion of property rights. And the second question is whether or not this will help more or less people in pandemic.
3531.12,3533.86, So let's look at both of those things in turn.
3534.06,3535.78," Firstly, on the question of the principle."
3536.5,3540.62, The opposition side establishes the principle pretty early on in the debate
3540.62,3544.24," by making the claim that corporations must have access to,"
3544.86,3546.5, or must be entitled to
3546.5,3549.96," profiting off of these, I guess, medical products."
3550.36,3555.36," They point to the fact that firstly, corporations tend to invest a significant amount of money"
3555.36,3561.62," in the process of innovating these technologies, for example, time, money, human resources."
3562.22,3566.72," And in addition to that, they characterize that this is likely to have been a consistent effort,"
3567.12,3568.98," not just something that, I guess,"
3569.36,3570.74," they do within the pandemic,"
3571.04,3573.24, but something that precedes the pandemic as well.
3573.52,3575.16," For example, the continuous development"
3575.16,3577.82, of the technology to vaccinate people
3577.82,3581.26," that, I guess, preceded the pandemic"
3581.26,3582.1, in the first place.
3582.84,3586.0, The additional nuance that's added from the
3586.0,3590.5, opposition side of this debate through the POI and through the DLO speech is the
3590.5,3596.26, question of whether or not the situation of a pandemic is one that was special or
3596.26,3601.78, one that required a different kind of solution on part of the government to do
3601.78,3607.22, with property rights. And so this meant two things in the debate for the proposition side.
3607.76,3613.22," Firstly, it meant that because the opposition side was able to prove"
3613.22,3618.78," that corporations had the property right and they were entitled to do that,"
3619.38,3624.34, the government side needed to explain why this could be ignored in the first place.
3624.34,3630.02, So there needed to be a substantial or substantive reasons from the government side needed to explain why this could be ignored in the first place. So there needed to be a substantial or substantive reasons from the government side to explain
3630.02,3633.26, why property rights did not apply in this case.
3633.26,3639.12, And that is the reason why the claim from the government reply was probably not relevant
3639.12,3643.64," in this debate, because at the point at which the opposition side proves that property right"
3643.64,3649.38," is well deserved, it is the burden of the government side to explain why that is not deserved in the first place."
3650.06,3654.3," The second one, and the government side have to deal with both of these things,"
3654.3,3661.58," is that the government side needed to explain why property rights do not apply in this instance,"
3662.02,3665.74, while maintaining consistency with the stance that you allow
3665.74,3671.3, property rights to exist outside of the pandemic. And I think both of these things were not done
3671.3,3676.16," well or well enough by the government side in this debate, which is the reason why the opposition"
3676.16,3682.64," side takes the principle clash. Let's look at both of those in turn. Firstly, I think the government"
3682.64,3687.98, side gives some explanation as to why property rights should not be respected in this instance.
3687.98,3696.02, I think the claim here is that property rights should be compromised because you could save a lot of lives.
3696.78,3703.42," And in explaining that, you point to the fact that these are large corporations that profit off of the situation."
3703.72,3706.16," And you point to corporate social responsibility, urgency of the situation, and you point to corporate social responsibility,"
3706.74,3711.72," urgency of the situation, you could save more lives, all that stuff. The problem I had with"
3711.72,3717.8," this is that whilst the idea that you want to save more lives is present, it has never shown"
3717.8,3722.54," why that becomes a justification to remove property rights in the first place, because"
3722.54,3728.82, there's no actual weighing or there's no actual reason as to why the fact that you could save more lives is a
3728.82,3733.38, justified reason to remove property rights that is well deserved by these
3733.38,3737.14, corporations in the first place. And that is the reason why I think the
3737.14,3741.54, explanation of why property rights could be ignored is insufficient in the first
3741.54,3746.06," place. But secondarily, I think there's an attempt"
3746.06,3747.38, from the government side to explain
3747.38,3751.88, why the situation of a pandemic was unique and special
3751.88,3756.34, and therefore required a different kind of approach.
3757.14,3759.86," The idea is that in normal situations,"
3760.16,3762.64," you have time and you have, I guess,"
3762.64,3767.9, the ability to use things like generic medicines to save people in general.
3768.6,3776.84," I think this was, I guess, an interesting approach, but probably not enough to differentiate a pandemic from other situations."
3777.2,3785.68," Insofar as the opposition side claims that even in normal times, there are a lot of people dying from you know lack of access to medicines well you probably"
3785.68,3790.84, do have things like generic medicines but that doesn't apply to like all instances different
3790.84,3797.1, illnesses that are not very well uh i guess uh medicines for which are not very well accessible
3797.1,3803.14, by the public but even if i accept that you do differentiate a pandemic from other situations
3803.14,3805.54," that is still insufficient because of the first explanation i give which is that you do differentiate a pandemic from other situations, that is still insufficient because of"
3805.54,3810.78," the first explanation I give, which is that you don't destroy the fundamental premise of the"
3810.78,3815.74," opposition case, which is that property rights must be respected in this instance. And that is"
3815.74,3819.98," why I think the opposition side were able to prove that property rights must be respected,"
3820.44,3825.52," even in this situation, which is the first reason as to why the opposition side takes this debate."
3830.2,3835.96, I think there's an interesting and quite an effective claim from the government side that the opposition side's model is a little bit inconsistent with their nuance or with their
3835.96,3841.06," principal claim. But in this debate, I didn't think that was a fatal mistake from the opposition,"
3841.6,3846.36," because despite the fact that they, I guess, propose, I guess,"
3846.84,3851.6," sort of an intervention into how corporations could use this technology, it doesn't seem to"
3851.6,3857.5, be that the model would hurt property rights or would deprive them completely. So while I do
3857.5,3862.58," accept that there is some kind of inconsistency, I still don't think that it hurts or completely"
3862.58,3873.98, destroys the principle nuance from the opposition side in this debate sufficiently such that the principle advantage that the opposition side has in the debate gets removed.
3874.2,3877.22, So that's the first reason as to why the opposition side takes this debate.
3877.64,3886.32," Secondly, I want to look at the practical outcome of whether or not this helps more or less people. The first thing I want to note here is that there is a counter-proposal"
3886.32,3887.3, from the opposition side
3887.3,3890.62," regarding how they want to deal with the situation,"
3890.88,3893.0," price control, licensing, all that stuff."
3893.48,3895.66," Unfortunately, I don't think there is a sufficient explanation"
3895.66,3898.36, from the opposition side as to how this functions
3898.36,3900.14, and what the outcome of that looks like.
3900.58,3902.06, There is an attempt at reply.
3902.34,3903.28, I think that's far too late.
3903.88,3927.82," It is just flagged at the leader's speech and not really explained or weaponized sufficiently. So I did not take that into account as much as there is restricted in the status quo. For example, corporations don't have any incentive to share."
3928.78,3935.18," The prices are high because the supply is short, all that stuff."
3935.5,3937.84," I think this gets enforced by the DPM speech,"
3937.84,3942.68, where you contextualize the debate by talking about large corporations' incentives
3942.68,3947.86," to monopolize the market, to which the opposition side gives some empirical responses to,"
3948.18,3954.54, but probably not structural enough to completely deal with this contextualization from the proposition side.
3954.88,3961.4," And there's an added analysis from, I guess, explaining how investors are likely to make decisions,"
3961.86,3965.32, why they're likely to maximize or they're likely to want to maximize
3965.32,3971.9, short-term profit. And all of that leads to an increase of crises regarding these medicines.
3972.18,3976.94, And that's why people don't have access to it sufficiently. I think that's well proven by the
3976.94,3982.3, proposition side in this debate. The opposition side is not successful in completely destroying
3982.3,3985.26," these claims, but I think they do enough to mitigate"
3985.26,3990.44," this claim quite substantially because they give reasons as to why corporations, despite the fact"
3990.44,3998.66," that there is monopoly or they're in a, I guess, position where they could abuse their privilege,"
3999.2,4009.76," have an incentive to still make it at least reasonably accessible to the public. For example, they point to the fact that they would want to sell their"
4009.76,4014.38," medicines despite the fact that they are in a monopoly. In order to do so, they"
4014.38,4017.44, must lower down the prices such that people could buy the products in the
4017.44,4020.58, first place. They also point to the fact that there are alternatives that
4020.58,4027.1, exist in the market so that people could choose they also explain that there is reputational incentives so that you know
4027.52,4031.26, People so that they have an incentive to save people's lives
4031.64,4038.4, Insofar as that is one of multiple KPIs that corporations use in the status quo and they say that this is
4038.66,4046.32, Empirically true in certain instances obviously not in all countries probably but in many countries that this is done sufficiently
4046.32,4052.5, well um obviously this is not a flip or like this is not something that completely disproves
4052.5,4057.36, government science premise but i think they're successfully proving that medicines right now
4057.36,4062.96, or vaccinations right now are not too expensive they're probably reasonably expensive not like
4062.96,4065.52, you know too expensive such that no one could use it.
4066.3,4072.6," I think, however, government sites' argument that access will increase as a result of releasing"
4072.6,4079.54, patents still stand in the debate. Now I want to look at opposition sites' push in this debate
4079.54,4085.08," regarding innovation. And I think this was the more important discussion in the debate,"
4090.78,4095.5," because here the discussion is whether or not the cure exists in the first place, which is a prerequisite for the government side's argument to stand in the first place. Because even if access"
4095.5,4101.28," is increased, if the cure is unlikely to exist in the first place, that benefit could not be accessed"
4101.28,4105.88, by the government side as well. The opposition side's characterization
4105.88,4110.6, and their analysis here is quite simple and straightforward. It is the claim that the cost
4110.6,4118.04," to innovate is massive because of the investment that you need to make, but the profit is massively"
4118.04,4124.2," decreased as a result of this policy. Therefore, you lose the incentive to innovate. And I think"
4124.2,4145.8," there is an added characterization that it is unclear and uncertain whether or not the vaccination or medical products that you innovate during pandemic will remain useful after the pandemic. as well. The direct response we hear from the government side regarding this is that, no,"
4145.92,4151.12, you would still be able to profit because there is a lot of demand and corporations could still
4151.12,4154.96," sell their medicines, despite the fact that other corporations could produce the same product."
4155.26,4160.0," But I think that was, despite the fact that it is a good mitigation, it's probably not enough to"
4160.0,4165.5," deal with the opposition's case because their claim, based on their characterization, is that"
4165.5,4168.0, it is not enough for you
4168.0,4169.46, to be able to earn some money.
4169.86,4171.6, You need a lot of money to recoup
4171.6,4173.76, the cost that you have to incur during the
4173.76,4175.18, innovation process.
4176.12,4178.16, And obviously the incentive of corporations
4178.16,4179.5, is not to innovate
4179.5,4182.18, and become a pioneer in the field
4182.18,4184.16, but to wait for other
4184.16,4186.6," corporations to innovate and then copy that off of them,"
4186.86,4191.26, which is probably the incentives that corporations would have under the proposition side.
4191.54,4195.4, So no corporation would be willing to actively innovate as a result of that.
4195.54,4210.92," Instead, they're likely to, for example, produce generic medicines as characterized by the lead of opposition speech, because that is an easier way to earn profit as opposed to innovating something that has uncertain returns in the"
4210.92,4211.14, future.
4211.9,4213.8, So that's the case from the opposition side.
4213.8,4217.74," I think at this point, they're able to explain that the incentive to innovate is reduced."
4218.26,4222.64," I think the government side responds to this claim through other ways, in two key other"
4222.64,4226.48," ways, in two key other ways actually. The first is to say that the information,"
4227.28,4232.78, so there's increased availability of information that accelerates the innovation process.
4233.7,4238.44," You explained that you have more information, responded to by opposition side by the way,"
4238.44,4242.74," and conceded to by the government side in reply. So maybe you don't have more information,"
4243.3,4246.28," but I think, yeah, the idea is there. And then"
4246.28,4252.48, you also explained that corporations could take advantage of their niche and effectively
4252.48,4259.74," innovate medicine. This is not, I think, obviously, in addition to the fact that the opposition side"
4259.74,4264.4," responds to this sufficiently, because, you know, in the process of applying for patents,"
4264.4,4265.22," you disclose your information, whatever. In process of applying for patents, you disclose"
4265.22,4266.26," your information, whatever."
4266.9,4271.84," In addition to that, however, I think this assumes the incentive to innovate in the first"
4271.84,4276.98," place, and then and only then this benefit materializes."
4277.1,4280.8," Because if there is no incentive, it doesn't matter whether or not the process of innovation"
4280.8,4283.18, is efficient or effective in the first place.
4283.4,4285.58, So I think this was not a crucial
4285.58,4291.6, response in this debate. I think what was better from the government side is the claim that there
4291.6,4296.62, are other reasons as to why corporations would still want to innovate. I think this mainly comes
4296.62,4302.72," up in DPM and the Whip speech in response to the opposition's case. Firstly, you explain that"
4302.72,4306.48, corporations still want reputation because they
4306.48,4310.5, want to be seen as the savior. They want to be seen as the corporation that saved millions of
4310.5,4317.14, people's lives. And also you explain that there is a lot of public pressurization as well as
4317.14,4321.58," pressurization from the government through the connections and lobbying that they have,"
4321.92,4325.68, which also incentivizes corporations to innovate products.
4326.12,4328.92, I think this was insufficient because of two reasons.
4329.28,4333.68, The first is just that I think there is a fundamental lack of explanation as to how
4333.68,4336.46, important these things are for corporations in the first place.
4336.76,4342.44," So there is presumably like public pressurization, reputational impact, connections."
4343.0,4344.5," Those things exist, sure."
4344.86,4348.12," But I'm not sure how important those things are for corporations,"
4348.74,4350.9, especially when the claim that opposition makes
4350.9,4352.76, is that you need to earn profit.
4353.12,4355.66, So it was important for government side to explain
4355.66,4358.6, why those things mattered enough for corporations
4358.6,4361.72, to be able to change their calculus in the first place.
4361.72,4368.26," But secondly, I think that reason is all the more enhanced"
4368.26,4373.58, to the extent the characterization that both teams agree on in this debate is that corporations
4373.58,4379.36," want profit. Notice that this comes up from the proposition side as well, when you explain"
4379.36,4389.02," that corporations are by and large influenced by investors that care about short-term profit. If this is true, I think this problem is all the more a bigger problem"
4389.02,4393.08," because, again, that kind of makes me unsure"
4393.08,4398.22, why things that don't seem to impact profit directly
4398.22,4403.02, are more important than the arguments from opposition side
4403.02,4404.56, that explain that this is not profitable.
4405.1,4412.12," So again, I think based on that characterization, it's reasonable to assume that the cost-benefit"
4412.12,4416.72," calculus that opposition side claims in this debate is more important than connections,"
4417.1,4419.84," pressurization, reputation that the government side talks about."
4419.84,4430.4," So for those reasons, I think it was insufficient. And therefore, I accept the opposition premise that corporations would lose the incentive to innovate quite substantially."
4431.2,4435.44," But putting all of that together, I think it is true that you increase access."
4436.0,4442.32," But at the same time, you are less likely to have the cure, have the vaccination in the first place,"
4442.44,4448.24," which seemed to be the premise of the government side's benefits to be accepted in the first place, and that is the reason why the opposition"
4448.24,4451.42, side takes the practical clash in this debate as well.
4451.64,4456.16," So for those reasons, I think the opposition side takes both the principle and the practical"
4456.16,4459.52," clash in the debate, and that is the reason why the opposition side took this debate."
4460.22,4462.88," But yeah, thank you very much for a great debate."
