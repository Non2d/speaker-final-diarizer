0.0,28.3," . Intention of the Western media,"
28.7,31.08, like revealing these dominant narratives
31.08,33.46," regarding the vulnerable women,"
33.86,35.46," they don't have the malicious intention,"
35.7,38.08, but they rather have good intention
38.08,40.22," in order to save women, save children."
40.22,42.3," But the outcome is different, Mr. Speaker."
42.54,44.9," Because they target these women are vulnerable,"
65.6,67.6," they target these children are so vulnerable that they are weak, they are nonviolent, that leads to propose. I'm going to talk about mainly three things."
67.6,71.6," First, see how this dominant narrative badly influenced post-conflict zone sexism."
71.6,79.6," Secondly, how this dominant narrative is badly affecting these women and children regarding these kind of terrorist attacks."
79.6,83.6," Thirdly and lastly, how this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexisms."
83.6,89.0," So first thing first, about this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexisms. So first thing first about the dominant narratives. So what we mean by dominant narrative is those, mainly"
89.0,95.12," those Western medias, like picturizing these women and children who are being raped, who"
95.12,101.36," are being brutally murdered in the conflicts or the humanitarian crisis zones, right? And"
101.36,105.88, they picturize those women and children being forced by the power of male and being
105.88,112.88, forced by the power that they are being raped and they are being weak toward those kind
112.88,113.88, of attacks.
113.88,119.78, They have the massive incentive to use women and children as a vulnerable and non-violent
119.78,124.88," actor is because it's pretty shocking that they're using the picture of women being raped,"
124.88,128.8," picture of children being stabbed by the knives or those kind of things, right?"
128.8,137.3, Because those kind of shocking pictures and shocking words are going to raise the viewing rate
137.3,139.8, or those kind of magazines or those kind of things.
139.8,146.26," Therefore, those Western media has a massive incentive to make those kind of narrative very dominant."
147.84,152.32," So as a consequence, by this kind of dominant narrative done by Western medias,"
152.32,157.22," there will be much more attention toward female victims than the male victims, Mr. Speaker."
157.56,162.12," For example, in Boko Haram, for example, in Syria, for example, in ISIS areas."
162.32,167.26," So as a consequence, what happens is that there will be a massive amount of discussion"
167.26,174.3, inside U.S. councils or WTOs or those kind of moral policies sending peacekeeping operations
174.3,179.32, or humanitarian aid toward those kind of women and children who are dying on the ground
179.32,181.32, inside those kind of conflict zones.
181.54,185.98, What happens is that peacekeeping operation and humanitarian aid enters conflict zones
185.98,188.0, and prioritize women and children
188.0,190.08, than the men. What happens is
190.08,192.22, that more male victims are going to increase
192.22,194.06, rather than those kind of female
194.06,195.96," victims, Mr. Speaker. This"
195.96,198.32," leads to the post-conflict sexism,"
198.46,200.12, Mr. Speaker. What do
200.12,202.1, I mean by this? It means that those kind
202.1,203.76, of male victims who are
203.76,205.6," brutally killed or male victims who are brutally killed,"
205.86,209.72," or male victims who are brutally injured by those kind of war operations,"
210.04,214.36, they feel that they need a reward in a post-conflict society.
214.36,217.52," They need some kind of class, they need some kind of money,"
217.78,229.34," they need some kind of reward that they have done in conflict zones. Therefore, they cannot give away their money or their tax"
229.34,235.54," revenues to women because they think that they were already saved by the Western society,"
235.54,240.18," they were already prioritized, then our lives in the conflict zones. We believe in that"
240.18,245.94," kind of scenario that leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker, that those males are getting reward"
245.94,248.24, and women
248.24,250.04, not getting nothing
250.04,252.1, in return because they have already got
252.1,254.04, those kind of rewards or the treatments
254.04,256.2, during those kind of conflict
256.2,258.08," zones. We believe, rather,"
258.48,260.04, like saving those kind of women
260.04,262.06, and males equally leads to
262.06,264.42, the betterment of these kind of situations
264.42,265.82, because those kind of male victims cannot to the betterment of these kind of situations. Because those kind of male
265.82,267.74, victims cannot make the excuse
267.74,268.56, that they were
268.56,271.94," deprioritized, they're male or female"
271.94,273.98," victims, and therefore they cannot use those"
273.98,275.66, kind of metrics. We believe this kind of
275.66,277.3, sexism is going to
277.3,280.06, better off on our side of the
280.06,281.84," house. Secondly, Mr. Speaker,"
282.16,283.76, those kind of dominant narratives
283.76,286.0, leads to more
286.0,287.6, targeting women and children
287.6,289.8, by the terrorist attacks. Why is that?
289.98,291.98, It's because those kind of
291.98,294.04," terrorists, for example, ISIS,"
294.36,295.72, knows that Western media
295.72,297.96, uses female and children as
297.96,299.68, a news title
299.68,301.78, or those kind of eccentric
301.78,303.76," news reports. Therefore,"
303.94,305.24, they have a massive incentive
305.24,308.12, to spread their political messages
308.12,311.12," throughout those kind of news outlets, right?"
311.36,314.2," Which means that by targeting women and children,"
314.52,317.46, they will have massive potential or possibility
317.46,319.8, to make their political messages
319.8,322.54," throughout those kind of Western medias, right?"
322.54,324.16, Because they know that Western media
324.16,327.56, have an incentive to use and target
327.56,331.98," those female victims' reports or the children victims' reports, right?"
332.2,338.42," Therefore, what those kind of Western media is doing is the opposite of their aim, Mr. Speaker."
338.42,344.66," They are trying to target those women and children and prioritize their lives,"
344.8,348.04, but what they are doing is the opposite.
348.04,356.42, They're rather giving those kind of opportunities for those terrorist groups to attack these
356.42,357.28, women and children.
357.54,359.44, We believe that is more horrible.
359.94,363.98," Thirdly and lastly, why this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexism."
364.36,369.0, So dominant narrative regarding women who are pictured as weak and nonviolent actors
369.0,374.0," is like that a hundred and thousand women who were brutally killed and raped,"
374.0,376.0, they were forced by men's power.
376.0,380.0, This is overly done by Western media and that leads to unconscious sexism.
380.0,381.0," Before that, yes sir?"
381.0,386.0, So why is a bit of more sexism more important than increased amount of aid or
386.0,388.0, aid going to people who actually need it?
388.0,394.0," Because Mr. Speaker, first of all, we want to question why do you prioritize women's"
394.0,401.0," lives over the male, right? We couldn't see why that is justified in the first place."
401.0,405.7," But second of all, we do not want, by equalizing those"
405.7,411.72," kind of aids and treatments, we believe that the post-conflict society is going to be better"
411.72,418.34," off, right, better off, Mr. Speaker, because sexism is something really rooted in the society"
418.34,428.06," and that is going to give less rights to women, Mr. Speaker. We believe that is important as well."
428.44,432.32," So by picturizing women as weak and nonviolent actors,"
432.6,437.9, that is going to make people unconsciously sexist toward women.
438.14,441.96," They're going to say that because you're weak, you cannot wear slutty clothes."
442.06,443.48," You're going to be raped in the town,"
443.8,448.42, but you cannot wear those kind of slutty clothes because you're weak.
448.78,455.6, This kind of narrative is going to be dominant and that is going to elicit women's rights and freedom.
455.74,457.8, We don't think that is the way to go.
462.18,466.0, Thank you for your remarks. Now I call for a little observation within seven minutes.
466.0,466.5, Here we go.
483.16,484.72," OK, three issues for a little."
484.72,488.64," Firstly, I want to talk about the realistic characterization of women in conflict."
488.64,494.0," We do recognize that some women are strong, who are capable enough to fight back against men."
494.0,497.12," But unfortunately, the reality is that in general,"
497.12,501.24," that women are likely to be comparatively more vulnerable than men,"
501.24,505.0," and comparatively more likely to target the atrocious food companies, thus"
505.0,507.0, they need more support and protection.
507.0,514.0, I think I'll never talk about why the dominant narrative uniquely makes it possible for us
514.0,519.0," and surroundings, or energy, or donors, to provide a necessary support, a decent amount"
519.0,523.0," of support, so that their women are going to be protected."
523.0,526.6," Before that, I'll present the response to the Prime Minister."
526.6,534.6," Firstly, they say that this dominant narrative incentivizes terrorists to exclusively target women in the conflict areas."
534.6,539.3," Firstly, we do consider that status quo is not perfect, but we think that due to this narrative,"
539.3,542.4, the situation is currently going to be changed.
542.4,545.42," For example, the criminal court actually introduced"
545.42,551.62, rape or sexual assault as crimes against humanity. And the international recognition that sexual
551.62,557.44," assault kind of requires special recognition. And also, international criminal court bashing"
557.44,567.0, towards the ignorance of the government who has the inability to deal with those sexual assaults.
567.0,575.0," But furthermore, when it comes to the media's emphasis on gaining attention, we think terrorist groups are also already relying on the other kind of thing."
575.0,579.0," For example, they are relying on the suicide attack or they are relying on the indiscriminate killing."
579.0,583.0, This is even more attractive when it comes to getting attention through the media.
583.0,589.7, So I don't think this is the core motive for the terrorist groups to exclusively target women on the ground.
589.7,594.7," They say that male protection is going to be on the mind, compared to the females."
594.7,599.8," But as I explained earlier, we think that given that women are likely to need special protection,"
599.8,601.8, we think it's proportionate and we think it's good.
601.8,606.24," Lastly, they say that this is a dominant narrative is linked to the post-context system."
606.24,609.26, But we think that if those leaders or men in the society
609.26,613.16," have the intention to discriminate women,"
613.16,615.52, we think that they are going to anyway find any excuse
615.52,618.48, to discriminate women or let's reward women on the ground.
618.48,621.64," Maybe for example, they may say that due to their pregnancy,"
621.64,624.56, women cannot unfortunately work exactly the same
624.56,625.24, as the men or so forth.
625.24,631.24," Those kind of excuses, anyway, sexists are going to find that kind of excuse and discriminate women."
631.24,633.76," But furthermore, even in that case, we have to be confident."
633.76,638.44," Why it's also a very kind of social position of the aspect of post-conflict study,"
638.44,643.0, it's kind of more important than the immediate help of the women and the conflict.
643.0,647.0, We think it's the other way around.
647.0,651.0, So to finish about the realistic characterisation of the women in the conflict.
651.0,660.0," So in general, women are fortunately likely to be comparatively more vulnerable than men for several reasons."
660.0,671.0," Firstly, physically, women are likely to be weaker or less physically capable to fight back at exactly the same level as men."
671.0,675.0, It's just that women are likely to be the target of the bombings.
675.0,680.0," But furthermore, women are exclusively likely to be the target of sexual assault on the ground."
680.0,686.82," We do recognize that men also can be the victim of sexual assault, but we think the rate is disproportionately higher"
686.82,688.5," on the men, female, right?"
688.5,690.02," We look at the reality, for example,"
690.02,692.66," we come to the abduction by the terrorist group like O'Hara,"
692.66,696.0," that almost all, most of the victims of the abduction"
696.0,698.2," are like the teenage girls in the school,"
698.2,699.7, and they're abducted by the terrorist group
699.7,700.72," on the fourth of March, right?"
700.72,702.24," So we think in the reality context,"
702.24,704.18, that those who are individual women
704.18,707.0," are more likely to be targeted, and we think they need special protection."
707.0,713.0," But furthermore, maybe certain need sanitary protection due to biological features."
713.0,719.0," Maybe for example, pregnant mothers who need much more protection, who are more vulnerable, etc."
719.0,728.0," So we think that women are likely to be relatively more vulnerable, than they need special protection and support."
728.0,735.0," So given that nature, we look at the second issue about why the dominant narrative is necessary to protect these women on the ground."
735.0,741.0," So we think that firstly, that those dominant narratives allow the peacekeeper operation,"
741.0,748.0, intervening military or any other individual etc. to provide more support to the women on the ground.
748.0,761.0," Maybe for example, when we come to this shelter which has a lot of women, maybe we can deploy more soldiers so that we are able to protect them more."
761.0,765.76," Or for example, we are giving them extra support, medical support, sanitary support"
765.76,770.76," for pregnant women, etc. And also, support is going to be available on the other side"
770.76,777.26," of the house. And also, as I already told you, the ICC's recognition of rape or sexual"
777.26,783.26, assault as a crime against humanity are also introduced due to this dominant narrative
783.26,787.0, that recognizes women as more vulnerable and more violent.
787.0,788.8, And we think it's beneficial.
788.8,792.8," But secondly, this dominant narrative allows the..."
792.8,793.8, I'd like to say.
793.8,794.8," Okay, sure."
794.8,798.8, What is the connection between ICC recognising sexual rape as assault
798.8,801.6, and making people believe that women are non-violent?
801.6,804.2," Oh, this is because, due to the dominant narrative,"
804.2,807.88, that surrounding people in the liberal democracy can't stand.
807.88,809.32," Women are more likely to the victim,"
809.32,812.24, more likely to be victimized than any other.
812.24,815.44," Thank you, that assault, right there, in Korea, etc."
815.44,818.12," So we think, yeah, that's really not the same."
818.12,819.64," But secondly, we think that, you know,"
819.64,821.36, the due to the source of the
821.36,826.56, the kind of enables the energy of the donors in the liberal democracy
826.56,830.7, or the advanced nation to think about the situation of the women on the ground and think
830.7,836.5," about what kind of space they are going to need, etc."
836.5,840.02, We think it's critically important because the majority of the average citizen in the
840.02,850.5, liberal democracy haven't experienced the situation of the conflict that much. It's kind of hard for individuals to imagine what kind of support they are going to need.
850.5,856.5, We think the dominant narrative allows those kind of resistant individuals who are carrying
856.5,861.5, the potential donors to the energy or support towards the women on the ground.
861.5,867.06," They are going to think that women may need,"
867.06,870.5," for example, special sanitary protection,"
870.5,875.66," or maybe want to need extra protection, extra deployment"
875.66,878.6, for the military due to the heightened
878.6,880.4, of the sexual assault.
880.4,884.18, And we think that's also the recognition of the world.
884.18,888.34, Understanding of the exact necessity of the sport
888.44,889.72," is very important, right?"
891.34,894.64, Because in order to maximize the utility of the benefit
894.64,896.86," from the sport and the donation,"
896.86,899.98, we think that this is critically important.
899.98,903.64, So overall we think that given that unfortunately
903.64,906.18, that women are more likely to be vulnerable
906.18,907.76," and target as a special crime,"
907.76,911.08, we think that it's beneficial and reasonable
911.08,914.48, to use the dominant narrative to support and help them.
917.78,919.38, Thank you for your remarks.
919.38,921.52, Now I have a whole point to give to Prime Minister.
921.52,961.74," We have seven minutes, here you are. в антибиотик-фраме и столкнется в имени и кирилл The Abbasid side claims that without this dominant narrative that women are nonviolent"
961.74,965.94," and very vulnerable in conflicts, you are not able to attract the media's attention,"
965.94,968.22," the Western's attention, and you're not able to,"
968.22,970.82, the NGOs in the West are not gonna be able to protect
970.82,972.86, the people who are suffering in conflict zones.
972.86,974.3, But we reject this analysis.
974.3,976.58, We think that there's a lot of people who are suffering
976.58,978.76," in those conflict zones, who are not women."
978.76,982.08," For example, maybe men's been chopped their hands"
982.08,985.54, because of this really aggressive guerrilla groups.
985.7,988.12, We think those kind of images can actually shock people
988.12,991.76, and feel that there's a necessity to actually reach out and protect them.
991.9,996.04," We think that those kinds of, we don't think that that dominant narrative"
996.04,998.18, of women suffering is something that's necessary.
998.36,1002.02," There's a lot of children who are suffering, men suffering, and also women."
1002.2,1004.18," We think that we can have women suffering,"
1004.18,1006.0," but we just have to have all kinds of people,"
1006.0,1011.0, they just show that all kinds of people are suffering. And we think that in itself is something that is enough.
1011.0,1016.0," We think that this kind of image that we are creating, that women are weak, women are vulnerable,"
1016.0,1022.0," actually makes women enabled to actually fight back, not only during the conflict zone,"
1022.0,1025.0," not only during the conflict zone, but also after the conflict zone,"
1025.0,1030.0," and we think we are making the woman in a weaker position, that is why we are very happy to propose this solution."
1030.0,1035.0," So I'm going to mainly talk about two things. First I'm going to talk about why age is still going to go to those kind of conflict zones,"
1035.0,1038.0, and secondly I'm going to talk about which is better for the female.
1038.0,1046.0," So, but before moving on to my points, I have a reputation to their side of the house."
1046.0,1052.0, So the leader of the opposition refuted to my partner that men will always make an excuse to actually exploit women.
1052.0,1059.0," Well we think that may be true, but if there's less excuses, that means that there are less reasons that they can justify their actions."
1059.0,1066.66," So we think that women, if there are less excuses, for example, women can just fight back and say that that is not right because I also contributed to the society."
1066.92,1069.98, I also fight back. I also contributed during the conflict.
1070.12,1072.94, So I should have the right to decide on my political will.
1073.28,1077.68, I should have the right to decide to go outside because I can actually protect myself.
1077.94,1082.98," If there's less justification for men abusing their power, we think women are able to fight back."
1083.14,1089.98," And we think that means there's going to be more women's rights and we think that in itself, even if men still can be abusive"
1089.98,1094.5," even if we take this proposal, we think that the degree is very, very different and we"
1094.5,1100.04, think that in itself is something that is a valid benefit. So first I want to talk about
1100.04,1105.72, why aid is still going to go in those kind of conflicts. So even if there's not a dominant narrative
1105.72,1108.72, that women are nonviolent and vulnerable.
1109.08,1110.14," So we are talking about, like,"
1110.46,1112.16, so they talked about we have to show images
1112.16,1113.6," that women are getting raped,"
1113.8,1115.52," that women are getting, like, for example,"
1115.8,1117.1, there's need to dominate narrative
1117.1,1119.34," of, like, women being, like, harmed and raped"
1119.34,1121.18, or those kind of things.
1121.38,1123.74," But we think that in places where in conflict zone,"
1123.8,1127.72," we think that not only, like, women are suffering of getting raped. For example, think that in places where in conflict zone, we think that not only women are suffering of getting raped."
1128.0,1130.7," For example, in places like in Congo,"
1131.8,1136.4, there are many children and many also men getting killed brutally.
1137.18,1140.02, Maybe they cut their limbs because they think that cutting limbs
1140.02,1143.72, would actually make their opponents weaker.
1144.3,1147.18, And we think that those kind of brutal images
1147.18,1149.32, can be shown even in our side of the house.
1149.32,1152.84, And we think that if media can find other images that
1152.84,1155.36," are very shocking, they have incentive to do it."
1155.36,1157.82," So we think that even if women is not being raped,"
1157.82,1160.88, and they don't show a dominant narrative
1160.88,1171.0," that women being raped, we think that it can also attract the media's attention if some people are actually suffering."
1171.0,1180.0," And we think that because there's an overt dominant narrative that women are getting, for example, suffering,"
1180.0,1189.98," we think that the amount of resources used to save the men or other people are not going to be used. And we think, at the end of the day, we think that the amount of people that can be saved are going to be the same."
1190.2,1193.74," We think on our side, maybe less women are saved, we can see to that."
1193.9,1198.66, But at least maybe more men are going to be saved because of this less dominant narrative.
1198.76,1201.38, And we think that in itself is not really a bad thing.
1201.38,1207.0, And we don't understand why they want to prioritize women over men.
1207.0,1213.32," We think all lives are equal and if men are more protected, we think that in itself is"
1213.32,1220.0, not really a bad thing. We think there are a lot of men who are suffering and we think
1220.0,1224.0, at the end of the day the number of people who are with us is the same.
1224.0,1227.8," So second I want to talk about which is better for the female at the end of the day, the number of people who are going to be saved is the same. So second, I want to talk about which is better for the female at the end of the day."
1228.0,1231.94," So firstly, about during the conflicts. So we think that because we"
1231.94,1235.5," actually internalize those, because"
1235.5,1239.96," NGOs or the West actually prioritize protecting women, we think"
1239.96,1243.98, women have less capacity to actually protect themselves.
1243.98,1245.1, What do I mean by this? Because there is no necessity for capacity to actually protect themselves. What do I mean by this?
1245.22,1248.44, Because there is no necessity for women to actually maybe arm themselves
1248.44,1250.64, because the West is there to protect them.
1251.02,1253.58, And because the West thinks that you have to be protected.
1253.86,1256.94, We think that is why women themselves do not arm themselves.
1257.28,1258.56," They said that women are vulnerable,"
1258.82,1261.46, so that is why women are not able to protect themselves.
1261.46,1264.56, But we think this narrative in itself actually makes women vulnerable.
1264.82,1267.38, We think women in themselves can to protect themselves. But we think this narrative in itself actually makes women vulnerable. We think women in themselves can actually protect themselves.
1267.38,1271.06," So if you have a gun, even if your man is much more"
1271.06,1273.84," masculine and have much more physical strength,"
1273.84,1275.36, you can kill that another person.
1275.36,1277.26, So we think that physical stress in itself
1277.26,1278.68, is not a matter in this debate.
1278.68,1280.88, So we think that those women can arm themselves.
1280.88,1284.06," And when they feel that they are capable to arm themselves,"
1284.06,1285.44," they won't be able to do it. But because they have this dominant narrative, they're so strong, they're not able to arm themselves, and when women feel that they are capable to arm themselves, they won't be able to do it."
1285.44,1288.48," But because they have this dominant narrative so strong,"
1288.48,1289.92, they're not able to arm themselves.
1289.92,1292.96," They think that they are vulnerable, they lose hope and protect themselves."
1292.96,1297.4," And that actually leads the women to being targets of, for example, a lot of terrorist groups,"
1297.4,1299.52, or they are getting targeted of getting raped.
1299.52,1304.28, We think this narrative in itself makes women weak.
1304.28,1307.2," Are you saying if this narrative doesn't exist,"
1307.2,1313.16, can you make women suddenly take guns and fight against men and protect themselves?
1313.16,1315.04, I'm talking about being comparative.
1315.04,1318.32," I don't think this is an absolute solution, but we have to be comparative."
1318.32,1322.24," That at least women will feel that, oh, I have to protect myself on my own."
1322.24,1328.94," And we think that, and that means that men will fear that, oh, if I actually attack this woman, maybe I might get like killed."
1329.22,1335.5," We think, we think that like kind of like, we think that the people's like thinking is"
1335.5,1339.36, going to change. And we think that women is going to be less target. And we also think
1339.36,1343.26," that they're going to be less target of like, for example, like Boko Haram or ISIS. And"
1343.26,1345.34, we think they never actually refused to do that.
1345.34,1347.1," And secondly, after conflicts,"
1347.98,1349.68, I'm gonna talk about after conflict.
1349.68,1351.2," We think that in the status quo,"
1351.2,1353.22," women are seen as vulnerable individuals,"
1353.22,1356.5, because they are seen as people who did not contribute
1356.5,1359.04," to the, during the conflict zone."
1359.04,1360.36," Maybe they did house chores,"
1360.36,1363.58," or maybe they did something, supported it."
1363.58,1365.66," But they are seen as secondary individuals,"
1365.66,1368.44," second class citizens, because there was less contribution."
1368.44,1372.18," That's what, and because you're seeing that these people"
1372.18,1374.42," are vulnerable and they did not contribute,"
1374.42,1377.94, we are making society can create a norm.
1377.94,1379.7," The woman is less contributing,"
1379.7,1381.28, so let's get them less friends.
1381.28,1382.96," And we are also sending a message,"
1382.96,1389.6," being supportive, for example, the people who are fighting, or doing house chores, it's also not a good contribution."
1389.6,1394.88," It's not something that is a significant contribution, and that makes women much more vulnerable"
1394.88,1398.56," after conflict zone. And we think that in itself is bad for the women, so that is why"
1398.56,1400.56, we are very happy with those.
1403.2,1445.52, Thank you for your remarks. Now I call upon you to delete the operation within 7 minutes period. I'll bring you two new subsanctists.
1445.64,1447.6," First, why the use of a vivid and vulnerable"
1447.6,1449.42, activity is to increase attention and
1449.42,1451.22, material support to areas. Why
1451.22,1453.46, the pining of the aid and support going to these areas
1453.46,1455.42," is not the same in two parties,"
1455.56,1457.46," but it increases all outside our house, because they have more"
1457.46,1459.66," vulnerable, clear images to the public"
1459.66,1461.54, where people feel more need and
1461.54,1463.58," sympathy to support these areas. Second,"
1463.7,1468.76," I'll talk about why this dominance of a radicalism is important, why people should be aware of the image of"
1468.76,1473.8," what women actually need, why that pre-exposure to the idea is necessary"
1473.8,1477.28," for people to in that chaotic immediate need to help people, they're able to"
1477.28,1480.58," understand what donation is necessary, what they should act right now, what inexperience"
1480.58,1486.26," in the area, knowing about situation is so important. But before I go on, a couple of independent"
1486.26,1488.12," reports. So, first,"
1488.34,1489.96," they talk about how, you know,"
1490.14,1491.96, it leads to some sort of sexism because
1491.96,1493.96," you know, they're vulnerable"
1493.96,1495.54, or something like that from the Prime Minister.
1496.0,1498.02, They told us what sort of sexism and action
1498.02,1500.22," it actually leads to, and I think the logic"
1500.22,1502.08," is very blurred. And also, we have to"
1502.08,1504.26," recognise that, you know, in these"
1504.26,1505.66," areas, or universally,"
1505.96,1510.04," helping women and children first as a man is a pride of a man, it's seen as a responsibility"
1510.04,1514.7," of a man. Also in any form of conservative religion, it's seen that it's the responsibility"
1514.7,1518.6, of the man to protect women and children first. That also adds to the fact that they won't
1518.6,1523.68," see that they are deprioritised or they are being abandoned, they see it as a pride that"
1523.68,1525.0, women are actually given more support.
1525.0,1528.0, They will facilitate to let women go on with it.
1528.0,1531.0, So it's wrong for them to say that men are so greedy and go on with it.
1531.0,1535.0, We think that those men do exist but are a minor part of society.
1535.0,1537.0, And we think that's a bizarre characterization.
1537.0,1541.0," But also, even if we can see that sexism might happen to a certain scenario,"
1541.0,1547.76, we think that it's far less important that people being saved by the fact that they were given sanitary goods. They're saved by the fact that they
1547.76,1552.24, were given food and clothing or protection from mosquitoes and things like that. That
1552.24,1556.1, was only possible because they had a substantial amount of aid provided to these people. And
1556.1,1559.46," we think that's far, talking about the lives of the individuals in that vulnerable situation,"
1559.74,1564.3," this bit of blood sex is far less important than that. Then, they also talk about from"
1564.3,1565.0, FPM and
1565.0,1568.96," BPM that, you know, they are seen vulnerable, so terrorists are likely to more attack them."
1569.2,1573.14," Or men are like to say that they are weak, so you should obey us or use it as a rhetoric"
1573.14,1577.1," for sexism and things like that. And firstly, I think Enlo talked about how terrorists don't"
1577.1,1581.22," really care about it, which was not responded. But further, there are plenty of other reasons"
1581.22,1585.4, for terrorist organizations or these men to be sexist on women in the first place.
1585.4,1590.5," There are reasons to say that, you know, for terrorists, they are intuitively weak in the physical sense."
1590.5,1597.6," They are intuitively, like, they may have greed for sexual desire, so there are other reasons to attack women first, unfortunately, as men, male soldiers."
1597.6,1603.9," Or they simply think that they have an extremist view, so for example, Islamic beliefs that say that they should subordinate women,"
1603.9,1607.82," so they should attack first instead of men, or they might have this strategic interest in attacking"
1607.82,1612.8," women groups, this historical know-how, as tribes and things like that. And given the"
1612.8,1616.28," fact that terrorists often don't really care about it, it's that this additional one reason"
1616.28,1619.48," of a narrative doesn't really change their calculus, because they already have tens of"
1619.48,1623.74," other reasons to do that. If the tens of other reasons don't change their calculus, I don't"
1623.74,1629.6, understand why this bit of a narrative that these terrorist people haven't been exposed to maybe has any
1629.6,1634.52," influence to it. And even if not, because even if you add it, because there's not much"
1634.52,1640.4," of a difference, the substantial difference is really unclear. Even to make male, trying"
1640.4,1645.82," to make it obedient, this sexist belief or preferences of men to go on with it already exist."
1646.02,1648.02, This bit of narrative that exists in the context
1648.02,1649.6, also has no clear method.
1650.44,1652.26, Sorry. It amplifies
1652.26,1654.22," that narrative, but it's not clear to what extent"
1654.22,1656.14," that's important. No, thank you. But also"
1656.14,1658.28," importantly, this narrative, as they set"
1658.28,1660.16," up, is a broadcasting of Western media."
1660.38,1661.88, It's not about how the narrative
1661.88,1664.18," formates in the conflict zone, but rather"
1664.18,1668.0," about people around the area. Not in the area, but around the world."
1668.0,1671.2," And we also think that also proves the fact that influence, as they once suggested, is"
1671.2,1672.2, not that huge.
1672.2,1673.2, Sure.
1673.2,1677.2," So, when have you found that these conservative sexisms are quite minor, limited to not minor"
1677.2,1678.2, people?
1678.2,1681.2," Now, as you're saying that a lot of conservative sexism does exist, so women will be able to"
1681.2,1682.2, get up with it.
1682.2,1683.2, Which is it?
1683.2,1685.68, There are a lot more conservative or less conservative?
1686.36,1688.3," I'm saying that if they do exist,"
1688.62,1690.04, it's that it's not going to be really
1690.04,1692.18, a big issue. So we're not saying
1692.18,1694.12, that they're a majority. I don't really get it.
1694.44,1695.98, Then there's a bit about ICC
1695.98,1698.0, and things like that. We understand that there's
1698.0,1699.8," not a clear connection between ICC,"
1699.98,1701.96," recognition of rape, and the vulnerability"
1701.96,1703.92, of women. The thing is that it was
1703.92,1706.02, necessary for the discussion and investigation of female issues the vulnerability of women. It's the same thing that it was necessary for the discussion and investigation
1706.02,1707.88," of female issues, even of course,"
1708.16,1710.32, that we needed social pressure
1710.32,1711.76, to have women being protected.
1711.96,1714.0," Because in the past, the PKO's"
1714.0,1716.36, reporting didn't even have a section for gender
1716.36,1718.36, or women. We didn't really investigate
1718.36,1720.1, the rape. It was all just about protecting
1720.1,1721.58, against guerrillas and things like that.
1721.82,1723.4, The only reason why this section was created
1723.4,1728.76, was because this vulnerability showed more social pressure on what's going on with women. Are
1728.76,1733.04," women really okay looking at the vulnerability of it? That led to United Nations moving,"
1733.24,1737.48, various other nations moving and forming this sort of section and that revealed the necessity
1737.48,1742.1," of the recognition of rape and things like that. So yes, there's no connection, but visceral"
1742.1,1745.0, vulnerability is what leads to investigation and check and balances
1745.0,1749.0," that often leads to better consequences like ICC, why it's so important."
1749.0,1753.0," So, it's substantive. Why the use of vivid image is so important."
1753.0,1758.0," Importantly, the support to these areas are vital to survival of people on the ground."
1758.0,1766.1," It might be aid, it might be intervention, it might be sanctions, but all of this is contingent on the fact that you have a necessary critical mass of people who care about the area,"
1766.3,1768.1, who are angered by the situation and want to support
1768.1,1769.9, these areas. The more support and
1769.9,1771.84," attention you have, you have more people"
1771.84,1773.84," saved, or quickly saved because of interventions"
1773.84,1775.48, that were done a bit more quicker.
1775.96,1777.56," Obviously, the sympathy that is"
1777.56,1779.8, created by the image of the media
1779.8,1781.94," is enhanced when you use more, unfortunately,"
1782.12,1783.54, more vulnerable-looking actors.
1783.86,1788.68, The use of the image of a woman is far more vulnerable looking than a man.
1788.9,1792.92, Also religious narratives and social narratives about how men should be obliged to protect women
1792.92,1797.7," also enhance the fact that when women are put in vulnerable positions compared to men,"
1797.7,1802.04, it provokes some emotional feelings that they should protect them compared to men.
1802.26,1809.96," They do have the two of children in their satellite house too, but the mixed use of women would also lead to accelerated power for"
1809.96,1814.16, to have more attention in these areas and that increased amount of power means that we are able to
1814.16,1817.82, save these people on the ground more and that means that more aids come around the satellite house.
1817.82,1822.44, So they say that men are going to receive less aid but if the power is increased they don't receive
1822.44,1828.62," less. But also even if we can see that men don't receive sufficient aid, it's that men have more energy and vitality"
1828.62,1833.36," compared to women, so they've been deprivatised in the situation of aid. It's far less important"
1833.36,1837.78, that women are being provided of their actual needs on the ground. Shortly on why dominant
1837.78,1842.5," narrative. Unfortunately, people, when they want to actually help a certain area, they"
1842.5,1845.24, just donate the things that they actually think they need.
1845.32,1847.16, But the clothing or the food that they actually provide
1847.16,1848.38, might not be a necessary thing.
1848.46,1850.1, It might be a burden to the actual area.
1850.34,1852.54," To prevent that, it's important that people expose"
1852.54,1854.12, the image of what actually women need.
1854.32,1856.62, The image that women are suffering in this particular way
1856.62,1858.82, through the Western media provides them the understanding
1858.82,1861.3," that the issues are rare, issues are sanitary conditions."
1861.3,1863.02," You need napkins instead of actual,"
1863.32,1865.68, these random foods or clothing and things like that.
1865.68,1871.28, That's only possible when the dominant narrative is also public and people are preemptively aware of the possible situation.
1871.28,1876.88," Inexperienced NGOs also will be able to be aware of the situation and not provide random unnecessary things,"
1876.88,1885.96," but actual needy things for women. That's only possible when we can have a narrative and not an alternative, systematic approach. Thank you."
1888.1,1906.0," Thank you for your remarks. Now I call for Garland Wood, the concerning interior.はいまずはやべぇ、わかんない"

1924.0,1953.86,"ふぅふぅ This debate is not about whether we are allowed to put this picture as, for example, MSF,"
1953.86,1959.28," like, for example, Red Cross, showing a picture that women are being brutalized in African countries."
1959.4,1962.96," This debate is about whether that should be dominant, whether that narrative should be dominant,"
1963.08,1968.32, that everyone believes that it is always a female who are being brutalized. It is always a female who
1968.32,1972.58," are never going to be violent, who are never going to be non-violent. Women are always"
1972.58,1976.48, weak. They cannot do anything by themselves. And that narrative should be dominated within
1976.48,1980.76," a society and make every person in a society, including the world, the United States, all"
1980.76,1984.94," the females in Africa, to believe that women should be non-violent. We do not think so"
1984.94,1987.0, because that obviously does not reflect our reality.
1987.0,1990.0, And we think that incentivizes multiple accounts of actors to believe

1993.0,1999.0," We can utilize them, we can exploit their weakness, which has been created by the Western media, to harm women."
1999.0,2002.0, We think saying that women are nonviolent and unbarnable does not protect women.
2002.0,2007.0," They are going to be more targeted, they are going to be exploited of the weakness which has been created by media, we think"
2007.0,2009.0," that's wrong, we should go against it to save women."
2009.0,2014.0," Are we talking about two things? One, is dominance necessary? Second, what is the effect of this"
2014.0,2020.0," narrative to society, especially in a conflict zone? Firstly, so what we heard from opposition,"
2020.0,2030.88," small number of materials, we won't dispute it because we also have small number of materials. One, they told us dominance is necessary because, one, it incentivized ICC to regard sexual"
2030.88,2032.26, rape as a crime.
2032.58,2035.76, So we should have a discussion that we should also care about it.
2036.04,2040.44, Because people have further discussion and people have thought deeply about this woman's
2040.44,2044.08," non-violence or vulnerability, we should include rape as a crime, so forth."
2044.24,2045.66," Firstly, we think that's wrong."
2045.76,2050.3," Still, we don't understand this idea of this non-violence or vulnerability leads to rape"
2050.3,2052.08," being regarded as crime itself, right?"
2052.22,2058.64, I think the Western male already knew in the 1980s and 1990s that women tend to be non-violent
2058.64,2059.76, as a political position.
2059.86,2061.86, Women tend to be vulnerable compared to men.
2061.86,2066.0," The reason I think, the more plausible reason is, they have been dismissing this idea of rape is because"
2066.0,2068.0," they have been quite male-centric, right?"
2068.0,2070.0, They don't care about this female agenda in these
2070.0,2072.0, developing countries right now. I think they have
2072.0,2074.0," been criticized a lot by the NGOs,"
2074.0,2076.0," or female movement, that even though you're saying"
2076.0,2078.0, that as an NGO or ICC that you're going to
2078.0,2080.0," protect the vulnerable, you're not really protecting"
2080.0,2082.0, those females who have been brutalized in the
2082.0,2084.0," underground, right? And we think that's the criticism"
2084.0,2088.06," that has worked, and that's why ICC become more gender neutral, right?"
2088.06,2089.64, I think that is more plausible explanation.
2089.64,2092.6, I don't think this idea of saying that non-violence or
2092.6,2094.9, vulnerability are the dominant narrative was necessary for
2094.9,2097.26, the ICC to incentivize the current rate.
2097.26,2099.24," That's like, obviously out of debate."
2099.24,2102.88," Second, they told us from the opposition,"
2102.88,2105.5," the dominance is necessary because you can get more aid,"
2105.5,2107.0, so PKO can get more support.
2107.0,2111.14," Firstly, we already have told you that if the Red Cross needs a picture to incentivize"
2111.14,2113.34," people to donate, they still can have children."
2113.34,2118.24," What we heard from BLO is that no, having one children is less better than having children"
2118.24,2119.24, and wives.
2119.24,2120.76, I don't get it.
2120.76,2126.0, I think having three children for brutalized booking is tantamount to showing children are mothers.
2126.0,2129.0, People don't make value judgment a difference on that point.
2129.0,2135.0," If there are lots of people who are brutalized and seem so horrible, they are going to donate anyway on our side of the house."
2135.0,2137.0, There is no exclusivity on this.
2137.0,2145.8," But more than that, we have to realize that the amount of donations that opposition is so half-ed about is not really important that much because the number of donations they can get"
2145.8,2147.86," from the individual donor is going to be far, far"
2147.86,2150.1, more smaller compared to this huge
2150.1,2151.96, chunk of donation that is given by the state
2151.96,2153.84," powers from the United States, Japan, and Britain."
2154.22,2155.98, We also have to have this
2155.98,2156.98, in consideration.
2157.62,2159.58, People and the entire society of citizens
2159.58,2161.82, don't care how much money I've been giving to
2161.82,2163.76, those developing countries in terms of donations
2163.76,2167.08, in terms of ODAs. That's why we don't even remember how much we've been paid to those developing countries in terms of donation in terms of early aids right that's why we don't even remember how
2167.08,2170.5, much we've been paid to China for example last year as our citizens right
2170.5,2173.88, so we think out of political decisions they can fund a lot based on the
2173.88,2178.42, necessities right so we don't think it's a comparative marginal benefit of aid
2178.42,2182.02, even if that does exist it's not that much of a dis-significance right we think we
2182.02,2188.1," can give the same amount of aid on both sides. Second, they told us dominance is necessary because people can understand"
2188.1,2192.94," this problem about sanity, right? So that's why people look at it as videos, NGOs, and"
2192.94,2197.76," so forth. Firstly, that again does not necessitate a dominant narrative itself, right? We're"
2197.76,2201.48," happy for NGOs to say there are specific problems for women, that there's problems happening"
2201.48,2207.64," about sanity. Even if that's necessary, we'm happy for those people to do it. But move it. I don't get it, right? Because people are just"
2207.64,2211.36," going to make a donation, and as they said, they told us, it's going to be easier for"
2211.36,2215.76," people to see that women's are being brutalized, and that image is far easier for people to"
2215.76,2219.6," donate, right? And if the NGO receives a huge amount of chunk of money from the donors,"
2219.92,2224.32," then they can just allocate it to the special needs, right? If the NGO at the local places"
2224.32,2225.24, in Afghanistan
2225.24,2228.76," thinks that their certain sanitary program does exist, we have to give a special treatment"
2228.76,2232.76," to women, they can do it by themselves, right? Why is it necessary for the population in"
2232.76,2235.92," the United States to understand that this specific technological problem, all this is"
2235.92,2239.44," happening in Afghanistan, they can just receive lots of aid, NGO can adjust it, we think that's"
2239.44,2242.76," fine, right? So there are a lot of specificity on this point."
2242.76,2247.0," And second, so let's talk about the impact for the entire population by second class."
2247.0,2252.0, We have told you from Prime Minister that this actually leads to a post-conflict settlement.
2252.0,2256.0," And they told us that one, they're going to find excuses from the leader of opposition."
2256.0,2262.0, What our policy does is to make people get away and forget about these excuses to begin with.
2262.0,2265.68," We think it is necessary for the Western society to treat male and female,"
2265.94,2268.04," well, maybe not children, but at least male and female"
2268.04,2270.04," quite equally, and show the stance that"
2270.04,2272.2," regardless of the vulnerability, we should treat them equally."
2272.5,2273.82, They are an important source for the
2273.82,2276.16," country like Iraq and Afghanistan, and we think"
2276.16,2278.18, we want those developing countries to follow
2278.18,2279.94, the values that Western countries have.
2280.12,2282.12, That's why we think those people are more likely to
2282.12,2284.06," think that sexism is something unfortunate,"
2284.32,2287.1," sexism is something wrong to have in our society, as Western countries have done."
2287.3,2289.72, We want people to follow it and forget about sexism.
2290.02,2295.18," They told us, next was, no, this conservative does exist anyway, and that's quite minus, right?"
2295.24,2298.64," We want to fix this conservative and modern conservative, but as a Western country,"
2298.72,2303.28," to show the sense that we want to treat those people equally, and you should treat the female and male equally,"
2303.54,2307.2, and forget about this conservative value in ourded society and that we think more likely
2307.2,2309.5, the developing countries follow our stance. Yes.
2309.5,2314.0," So here it looks like you regret the broadcasting, you totally change the stance and regret the"
2314.0,2318.7," theoretical dominant situation. What do you support, you need to compare how broadcasting"
2318.7,2321.0," has happened, what sort of narrative should exist?"
2321.0,2326.2," We want a society where broadcasts kind of become, I guess. We just want to oppose domination itself."
2326.54,2330.16," So what we're saying is, maybe if the ones, for example, CNN broadcasts"
2330.16,2332.46," the way women have been brutalized, we're not opposing itself."
2332.74,2335.94," What we're saying is, the BBC, CNN, Russia Today, whatever,"
2336.2,2338.7," all sorts of media broadcasts are keep repeating the word,"
2338.8,2340.92, it is always the women and children who have been brutalized.
2341.06,2342.86, We want to avoid the dominance itself.
2342.86,2346.92," We're not opposing to the idea of women being brutalized and broadcasting itself, right?"
2347.02,2350.96," We think that may happen, but fine, because that's what this debate requires us to do,"
2351.02,2351.16, right?
2351.22,2352.94, We want to oppose the dominant narrative itself.
2353.36,2360.16," Second, um, they told us, well, oh, fuck, um, what did I drop?"
2360.9,2362.18," Oh, so, oh, there's nothing else."
2362.18,2362.98," There's nothing else, right?"
2366.0,2402.0," Well, whatever. I'll hurry up.どうしたんだっけ?あ、でもあと7文字がないんだよねまあいいか、急ぐね ."
2402.0,2405.0," Mr. Speaker, in order for government side's argument to stand in this debate,"
2405.0,2409.0," they have to, they must have proven two things, which actually have been explained"
2409.0,2411.0, coming from the government side.
2411.0,2415.0," First thing is, by removing this dominant narrative, women are going to fight against"
2415.0,2418.0," late and successfully fight against late, and also men are going to hesitate to attack"
2418.0,2422.0," men to some extent, even though it's 100% men will change to some extent."
2422.0,2424.0, That's a bad proof of government side.
2424.0,2428.0," Second thing is, without this narrative, women are going to suddenly make contribution in"
2428.0,2433.0, conflicts and they are admitted as a legitimate actor and not recognized as secondary human
2433.0,2437.0, beings or so forth. That is the explanation from the government. But they never have
2437.0,2442.0, substantiated how women are going to contribute to a conflict society in a conflict situation
2442.0,2446.92," and going to be rewarded after conflict, Even though they told us in so many situations,"
2446.92,2449.8, there's already sexist context in their side of the house.
2449.8,2453.48, There's no mechanism of change of sexism in their side of the house.
2453.48,2457.68, And also I want to clarify what kind of narrative we are supporting for
2457.68,2458.18, our side of the house.
2458.18,2460.44," Because government suddenly accepted the narrative,"
2460.44,2462.22, because they identified from Prime Minister.
2462.22,2463.52," From Prime Minister they told us,"
2463.52,2466.64, they are talking about a shocking image in broadcasting of Western media
2466.64,2471.8," and those kind of shocking image creating dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, women are non-violent."
2471.8,2477.38," That is a set up coming from Prime Minister. Then some of the government website is about theoretical dominant narrative,"
2477.38,2482.82, women are vulnerable and 100% they go against the rape or those kind of attacks.
2482.82,2486.0, And it's 100% safe for men to rape women
2486.0,2490.0, those kind of like theoretical narrative from their side of the house.
2490.0,2492.0," I don't think it's realistic, right?"
2492.0,2497.0," Because even though we have dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, it's not 100% safe."
2497.0,2505.0," Maybe sometimes women are going against, going to fight against men, and sometimes not."
2505.0,2506.56, That's the exact theory we're talking about.
2506.56,2509.38," So we are arguing how shocking image, or those kind of,"
2509.38,2512.1," you know, messed up by NGOs, or those kind of Western media,"
2512.1,2515.24," is actually beneficial, harmful, for protection of people"
2515.24,2518.32," in need, or also, it is, we don't know, those kind of,"
2518.32,2521.12, those kind of detection is better for post-conflict sex
2521.12,2524.1, than that Prime Minister has set up with Tibet.
2524.1,2526.0," With that being said, I'll talk about two things in my speech."
2526.0,2530.0," First of all, during conflict, the pet side can better protect people in it, including men."
2530.0,2534.0," And also, I want to secondly talk about post-conflict sexism and post-conflict female rights"
2534.0,2537.0, that is also talked about by the government side.
2537.0,2541.0," So firstly, we told you from Dikti earlier about the position that"
2541.0,2543.0, pilot aids can be changed in our cyber-halls.
2543.0,2550.0, They are talking about the pilot aid of the necessary AIDS for male victims are suddenly deprived in our cyber house
2550.0,2555.0," and it's very unfortunate. But we told you, right, because it is a very shocking image,"
2555.0,2563.0, it is attracting many people in Western media and Western countries to pay attention to those kind of situations
2563.0,2565.0," and actually they are shocked and surprised. They are incentivized to to those kind of situations, actually they are shocked and surprised."
2565.0,2567.5, They are incentivized to help those kind of nations.
2567.5,2572.5, We think that is a unique mechanism how people are going to help those kind of situations in their side of the house.
2572.5,2577.0, Only what was coming from government today was that detection of children is enough.
2577.0,2583.0," But firstly, it's inconsistent with Prime Minister because they are saying that rape, women, or those kind of detection"
2583.0,2588.74," is very effective for Western media to attract audiences in the outside of the house. And also pragmatically, it's"
2588.74,2593.14," very difficult to differentiate children and women, because in a complex situation, in"
2593.14,2598.1," many cases, children and women are running together towards safe spaces, and they are"
2598.1,2601.66," detected together in the outside of the house. That's why we think, pragmatically, it's"
2601.66,2606.0, very difficult to differentiate women and children as vulnerable
2606.0,2607.0, outside the asylum house.
2607.0,2612.0," That's why, Mr. Speaker, we think our side is even better for men because total PI of"
2612.0,2614.0, AIDS will increase in the asylum house.
2614.0,2619.0, And also it is going to increase more accessibility for men because TKO and people in TKO don't
2619.0,2630.6," say, because you are men, you shouldn't receive this kind of medicine, this kind of support. That's why fire spray is increased. It also increases the necessary care for men in outside the house."
2630.6,2633.4," Also, we talked about special care for women."
2633.4,2638.0," And they say, NGOs can say, there is special care necessary for women. That's enough."
2638.0,2640.2," But it's consistent with our case, Mr. Speaker."
2640.2,2642.6, We told you there is special care necessary for women.
2642.6,2646.0, That means women are particularly vulnerable in their health.
2646.0,2650.0," They are on the side of government, and they are on our narrative, Mr. Speaker."
2650.0,2654.0, They also told you that there is an international effort to protect women by this narrative.
2654.0,2657.0," Like, it wasn't by the Silk Road as they cast, like, crime against humanity."
2657.0,2667.66," Then they said, like, government is not due to this narrative, and it's rather because we became sensitive to female rights and human rights in general. But it's true to some extent, but"
2667.66,2671.94," intuitive recognition that women should be helped, women"
2671.94,2676.08, need help from those kind of humanitarian clients. We think that is
2676.08,2680.12, also the pushing power and driving forces for international community to pay attention
2680.12,2684.08, to the situation of women itself. It's not a logical connection between human rights
2684.08,2686.0, or those kind of things.
2686.0,2688.0," We intuitively think they need help,"
2688.0,2690.0, that's why we help them. That's the unique mechanism
2690.0,2692.0, we told you from the earlier about
2692.0,2694.0, opposition. And also we told you
2694.0,2696.0, that big narrative is not so important for militants
2696.0,2698.0," there. Anyway, terrorists"
2698.0,2700.0," kill many people. Anyway, those"
2700.0,2702.0, kind of conservative people will kill
2702.0,2704.0, women. But we told you
2704.0,2706.58, at least militant and legitimate entity
2706.58,2708.08, are carrying it because they're
2708.08,2711.84," the human, crime against humanity, or those things."
2711.84,2713.5," That's why in a comparative manner,"
2713.5,2716.44," we think that we're trying to, we are successfully"
2716.44,2718.86, helping more women in outside of the house.
2718.86,2721.82," So, above all, their case might be standing"
2721.82,2724.58," in a logical level, but after we explain the context"
2724.58,2733.0," and characterization of the situation of the people there, their argument wasn't realistic in most chaotic situations in the world."
2733.0,2736.0, They don't care about those kinds of human rights.
2736.0,2746.28," Then also, they are like, they will be, um, okay, okay, so moving on to my second point. So, from their side of the house, they said the reason why women are less treated"
2746.28,2749.68, in a post-conflict society was that male victims
2749.68,2752.18, weren't safe while women are already safe.
2752.18,2754.16, And also that men feel they deserve reward
2754.16,2756.24, or higher rights because they contribute
2756.24,2759.44, to the ends of conflicts than women.
2759.44,2761.82," But Mr. Stieker, regardless of the existence"
2761.82,2768.9," of this narrative, women have relatively more difficulty in contributing to the conflict of humanitarian crisis"
2768.9,2771.9, in this military purpose of physical contribution.
2771.9,2775.8," Because just because we remove those kind of narratives,"
2775.8,2778.0," women are not suddenly going to participate in military,"
2778.0,2782.1, so not trying to solve the humanitarian crisis in their side at all.
2782.1,2783.4, So which is better?
2783.4,2786.5," In their side, women are not recognized as non-vulnerable,"
2786.5,2788.3," and maybe sometimes violent,"
2788.3,2790.6, but they are not contributing to the conflict.
2790.6,2793.6," But in our side of the house, women have justification"
2793.6,2795.0," not to contribute to the conflict,"
2795.0,2796.7," because they are vulnerable, they're physically,"
2796.7,2798.1, comparatively weaker.
2798.1,2800.2, That's why they systematically couldn't contribute
2800.2,2801.1, to the conflicts.
2801.1,2802.8," That's why, even though they didn't contribute"
2802.8,2805.0," to the, like, conflicts, they don't"
2805.0,2812.0," they are not recognized as so irresponsible after the dot-com thing. We told you how, right?"
2812.0,2818.0," And also they are saying that in post-conflict society we were targeted on the 3D, we were told not to wear"
2818.0,2822.0," slatty clothes, this dot-com thing. But we are not talking about those kinds of narratives."
2822.0,2829.36," Because we are talking about narratives like conflict, right? Maybe things come through rural societies, come to more safer places, it is different,"
2829.36,2833.28," dominant morality, women can do anything that they want."
2833.28,2838.56," We see we are talking about narrative in conflict, post-narrative, during the conflict situation,"
2838.56,2843.84," totalitarianism, we see, even though, logically, there are some arguments standing,"
2843.84,2846.0, we see even though post-compact female rights
2846.0,2849.0, we are seeing outside the house.
2854.0,2871.1, Thank you for your remarks. Now I call for abortion reply from Ms. Moni Ndidi. Two very simple questions.
2871.4,2872.62, Is the dominance of the narrative
2872.62,2873.6, important and better?
2873.92,2876.94," Second, could the dominance be toxic?"
2877.54,2878.92," So, from negative, we told you"
2878.92,2879.94, that the dominance of the narrative
2879.94,2881.7, is important in three variety of ways.
2881.92,2883.1, We firstly told you it's better
2883.1,2884.8," for the check and balance of the conflict zone,"
2884.88,2889.04, like we're able to establish the condition of rape in ICC. In a similar
2889.04,2893.86," way, we have numerous check and balance institutions going on in complex situations, situations"
2893.86,2897.5, of humanitarian crisis. More pressure would lead to better institutions and check and
2897.5,2902.42," balances of enforcement of those institutions. Their response from government was, you know,"
2902.52,2907.76," it's probably a different reason, probably was male-centric and was able to tackle that."
2907.76,2911.5, But they don't deny the fact that it was ultimately pressure that changed the situation.
2911.5,2913.5, What we told you is not that the reason doesn't matter.
2913.5,2918.16, We told you that this vulnerability leads to more social pressure to check on the situation
2918.16,2922.58," of women, and that social pressure collectively moves the government, collectively moves international"
2922.58,2925.76," organisations, collectively moves the United Nations to change conditions."
2925.76,2930.24," So yes, it might be that reason, but this narrative, the more dominant it is,"
2930.24,2934.24, creates more of that pressure and creates more reason for the check and balance to be implemented.
2934.24,2936.16, So that was an unbiased response.
2936.16,2940.08," Second, we all told you, that it creates at least more aid, the pie is not,"
2940.08,2942.16," pie is an exclusive thing, they get less."
2942.16,2945.3," Their response is that, you know, children are enough to create sympathy,"
2945.3,2949.0," but also people don't care about the OEDA, which my partner dealt with."
2949.0,2953.5," It's that the combination of children and women are the other related context,"
2953.5,2955.7, and that's why people are more able to sympathise.
2955.7,2960.7," They don't engage with the nuance of the fact that some people might sympathise with children,"
2960.7,2967.78," but you have to recognise some people also increasingly sympathise with women more than children. We are able to grab the minds of these people, which means that we"
2967.78,2971.26," are able to have more people driven to say that they want to send goods to these areas,"
2971.46,2974.82," they want to donate to these areas, and things like that. So children might be sufficient,"
2975.04,2978.5," but they miss out on the important individuals and conflicts, like feminists or other individuals."
2978.86,2982.82," But also, see, it also lacks a nuance when we tell you that, you know, it's too much"
2982.82,2988.0, of a particular role because they're associated with sexual bullying like rape or gruesome attacks and things like that.
2988.0,2990.6, That sort of narrative is impossible when you only use children.
2990.6,2995.2, That is the most tragic and constant detrimental situation that people don't even imagine it.
2995.2,2997.1, And that's why they want to help the situation.
2997.1,2999.7, They are moved viscerally that they have to help the situation.
2999.7,3004.4, That is why women are particularly important too in showing the vulnerability of the situation
3004.4,3008.0, and they simply don't very negatively attempt to say that it's no different.
3008.0,3011.6," So it seems that here the unique power, we get more power to provide aid and why this"
3011.6,3012.6, is a better issue.
3012.6,3016.5, But we also told you that it's important that we have better understanding of the conflict
3016.5,3017.0, situation.
3017.0,3021.0," It's not that you need more firepower to protect against guerrillas, you need charity"
3021.0,3030.0," provisions, you need more protection about privacy, or better allocation of refugees to avoid rape between men attacking women and things like that."
3030.0,3034.0, And their response was that it's the NGOs that have to understand it.
3034.0,3040.0, But that's not the point. What we're telling you is that these NGOs also might be inexperienced or unaware of what is actually necessary.
3040.0,3042.0, They just go there because they want to help them.
3042.0,3046.4," That's when NGOs fail to apply the actual needs of women, misallocate the positions of men and women"
3046.4,3049.06, when rape might happen in refugee camps and things like that.
3049.24,3051.3, You are only able to prevent that ultimately
3051.3,3053.72, because if you understand the situation preemptively
3053.72,3055.96, and are able to allocate or provide goods beforehand
3055.96,3058.96, or people donating to these areas because they know already.
3059.2,3062.28," If not, they send useless things or too many things"
3062.28,3063.94, that are too abundant on these areas
3063.94,3067.32, and that's the way to adopt these areas. No response to that. What is it
3067.32,3070.86," compared to the substantiated harm that we've been provided? It's all about sexism,"
3070.86,3074.46, terrorism and things like that. We told you there are a variety of other reasons for that to
3074.46,3078.12, happen. We don't understand why this scenario was particularly in the industry amplified
3078.12,3081.9, as the strongest thing. We also told you that particularly men are held to
3081.9,3085.06, responsibility and pride in the fact that they help women.
3085.32,3090.32, It would be a shame if they say that women deserve to contribute less
3090.32,3094.92, and it's okay that we feel wrong for women that they didn't contribute.
3095.06,3097.64, They feel pride in the fact that they're helping women and going on with it.
3097.8,3099.08, There was no response to that characterization.
3099.64,3101.84," But further, there was no response to what we're saying,"
3101.96,3104.76," that this debate, as I said, is about Western narratives."
3104.76,3107.74, We are not sure why this conflict zone or humanitarian crisis area
3107.74,3112.84, is looking at BBC or the exposure of direct narrative in the first place. That's why when they talk about the
3112.84,3116.5, mindset being changed by the narrative of terrorists or people on the ground they didn't actually
3116.5,3121.0," prove the connection. So sexism at best is not substantial, it impacts on"
3121.0,3124.96," mechanism or it clearly proves to you direct benefits, more aids, more actual"
3124.96,3129.4," tangible necessary support for the people, I'm proud of you folks."
3129.4,3160.0, Thank you for your remarks and I hope on a government-led There was a news report showing the video of Syrian child who was drowning in the sea.
3160.0,3169.74," That kind of video, it was sufficient and efficient enough in order to move public opinion toward acting against refugee crisis."
3169.74,3179.78, We believe those pictures or the video of a child or one woman or one man brutally being killed or brutally being injured
3179.78,3185.0, is something efficient and sufficient enough in order to move the public opinion.
3185.0,3191.5, Their word of proof is that why dominant narrative of women being exposed in the westernized media
3191.5,3198.3," is something important in order to gain money, in order to gain donation, in order to gain humanitarian aid,"
3198.3,3200.8, which was never proven from the side negative.
3200.8,3206.3, We already told you from the Delegate Leader of the Deputy Deputy Prime Minister and government whip that that is not enough
3206.3,3207.8, to win today's debate because
3207.8,3210.02, this kind of dominant narrative
3210.02,3211.96," means that BBC, CNN,"
3212.3,3214.22," those kind of New York Times, they are always"
3214.22,3216.3, saying that women are being
3216.3,3218.06," the target, women are being the victims,"
3218.36,3220.46," women being vulnerable, women being non-violent."
3220.84,3222.22, That is the
3230.22,3234.9," dominant narrative that they have to prove in today's debate. So we gave you two problems from the affirmative. Firstly, how the dominant narrative affects"
3234.9,3242.24, females' lives. We told you that they are used as a tool of the terrorist groups. Opposition
3242.24,3245.88, told us that terrorists do not depend on such method or the tactics.
3245.88,3249.82," Well, that is, for example, they told us about"
3249.82,3252.28," the suicidal bombing or those kind of things, right?"
3252.28,3256.84," Mr. Speaker, that is only limited to ISIS"
3256.84,3257.76, or those kind of things.
3257.76,3259.32, But we have already had those kind of
3259.32,3261.4," vocal harams, like,"
3261.4,3268.12," vocal harams using those kind of females' lives in order to send those kind of political messages, right?"
3268.32,3272.92," Really, those kind of examples do not make them win this point."
3273.14,3277.56," But secondly, we told you that the dominant narrative creates sexism in post-conflict society."
3277.56,3282.56, The deputy leader of the opposition said that men do not do such kind of sexist actions
3283.08,3286.56," because they have a pride, they have a duty to protect women."
3286.82,3288.96," But Mr. Speaker, from the leader of the opposition,"
3289.32,3293.76," he said that, well, they are going to create some kind of another excuse"
3293.76,3297.1, in order to continue doing those kind of sexist actions.
3297.1,3302.58," Well, there is a contradiction in those kind of characterizations of the conservative males."
3302.88,3305.36," Therefore, Mr. Speaker, they could not prove"
3305.36,3311.92," why those kind of, why these post-conflict sexism do not happen in post-conflict society."
3311.92,3316.88," They could not prove those kind of points. Therefore, like given that, opposition told"
3316.88,3322.56, us that the post-conflict sexism is much less important than immediate protection of female
3322.56,3325.12," lives. Well, Mr. Speaker, they are underestimating"
3325.12,3330.2," the power of the sexism. It can lead to honor killing, it can lead to stoning, it can lead"
3330.2,3334.78," to the threat of female life, Mr. Speaker. We live in that kind of situation. That is"
3334.78,3340.0, not a mere dichotomy between lives and mere sexism. This kind of sexism cannot easily
3340.0,3346.18," lead to the death or the threatening of females' rights. We believe that is horrible, right?"
3346.48,3348.06," Therefore, Mr. Speaker, what we"
3348.06,3350.08, told you in today's debate is that
3350.08,3351.64," one, those kind of"
3351.64,3354.18, post-conflict sexism is something
3354.18,3355.92," horrible, something that can"
3355.92,3358.12," threaten females' lives. And second of all, we told"
3358.12,3360.34, you that the dominant narrative is affecting
3360.34,3362.0," the current females' rights,"
3362.16,3364.18, the current females' lives. They are making
3364.18,3368.88," terrorists to attack females. They are making terrorists to give them retribution, or to give them"
3368.88,3373.58," the opportunity to kill females, rape females in the current status quo."
3373.58,3379.06," Really, what they told us is that it's not mutually exclusive. Their benefit to gain"
3379.06,3386.04, money and gain more prize and allocate to females is not mutually exclusive. That can only be done
3386.04,3391.62," by children, that can be done by male victims who are brutally killed, brutally injured."
3391.62,3396.02, We believe they cannot fulfill their burden of proof. We win this debate.
3398.84,3402.28," Thank you for your remark. Now all the speech, I want to thank you for your congratulations."
3403.0,3403.24, Thank you.
