0.0,4.56, This is round one of the website 2019.
5.52,9.78, Motion for this house to abolish intoxication defense in criminal cases.
10.06,11.84, I call all prime ministers to speak up for this motion.
12.26,13.6, It stands in their name.
24.64,31.0," Sir, victims of rape and violent assault have not for so long, are not"
31.0,36.4, being compensated because of the intoxication defence. When public officers raped women
36.4,43.4," being drunk, knowing that being drunk actually deprives him of the ability to judge reasonably,"
43.4,46.06, he got only three months of suspension from
46.06,53.8," his job. He didn't lose job at all, and he was just released after his sentencing for"
53.8,59.04," three months. We think simply that's not enough, and we think intoxication defence is illegitimate"
59.04,63.16, as a form of defence. We are very happy to propose this motion today. I have two things
63.16,65.0, to tell you from my speech.
65.0,67.0," Firstly, how the status quo of intoxication defence"
67.0,69.0," exacerbates the violent crimes such as rape,"
69.0,73.0," and secondly, why intoxication defence is illegitimate"
73.0,77.0, and should be abolished from the perspective of the criminal justice system.
77.0,79.0," But before that, several points of model, right?"
79.0,82.0," So, of course, Mr Speaker, we are very happy to inform"
82.0,85.54," how alcohol deprives you from the ability,"
85.74,89.98, deprives a person's ability to judge and act reasonably.
89.98,94.08," We think through the educational processes that we are doing right now,"
94.2,100.84," we think that before drinking, he should know that his judgment ability would be probably diminished."
101.12,103.62, And we are very happy to inform for those information.
103.94,109.0, And we also support rehabilitation centers when you are in prison or whether or not you are
109.0,113.5," in prison or not, you can actually go to the rehabilitation centre if you have that alcohol"
113.5,118.5," problem and you will be better, you should probably feel the responsibility when we abolish"
118.5,130.0," the intoxication defence. But the point is, at the point in which you drink knowing that alcohol causes you to judgment problem, then you will be responsible"
130.0,135.44," fully for the action you do during the time of being drunk, right?"
135.44,139.5," So having drunk like that, then you move on to the first issue, right? So the"
139.5,145.0," status quo, intoxication defense, exacerbates the violent crimes. So simply we think the punishment"
145.0,153.34," mitigated based on you being drunk, by mitigating this based on being drunk, victims are not"
153.34,157.28, enoughly compensated. They feel their damage and damage isn't really fully
157.28,163.44, compensated and also the criminal also don't really regret the problems that
163.44,165.76, they caused during the drug and they actually
165.76,173.0, end up causing repetitive crime and we think this possibility will be higher under their product.
173.0,180.5, What if the individual is intoxicated by side effects of a medicine that they prescribed?
180.5,188.0, Your cases are just about specific cases of rape which are rape coaching and criminal justice and does not accommodate the variety of cases of intoxication.
192.0,194.0, I'm not sure I will answer that.
194.0,200.02," So, why does this happen? First you think that when you drink, you know that you'll be"
200.02,212.24," excused to some extent, right? Just like the public officer who said in the court that I was drunk, I couldn't really control myself, and he lost, he just mitigated his crime,"
212.66,217.04," and said this, and only stayed in three months, he knows that he will be excused, and at the"
217.04,222.68," point in which you drink and you do some stupid things, you know that you'll be excused, right?"
222.7,226.2," But secondly, socially also you seem to be executed, right? The narrative"
226.2,228.02," that surrounds this crime, because"
228.02,230.08," you're a drug, you're not"
230.08,232.18, as responsible as other
232.18,233.96," cases, right? We think that's"
233.96,236.04," really, that's the kind of norm that's"
236.04,238.12, created through this system because the state
238.12,240.0, officially recognizes as a
240.0,241.72, mitigating factor and legitimate
241.72,243.88," cause of defense, right? So"
243.88,245.16," as a result of that, two"
245.16,249.12," harms happen. Firstly, victims are damaged in the court trials, in the process of court"
249.12,255.24," trials, when they hear that the offender says, because of alcohol, I wasn't irresponsible,"
255.4,259.28, right? We think that narrative stuff that exists in the court is very harmful for victims
259.28,266.42," to enter the court, and we think that's a double jeopardy for these victims. But secondly also there is a repetitive, there is"
266.42,268.22," a danger of repetitive crime, right?"
269.0,270.32, Please note that the drug
270.32,272.12, rape problem has a repetitive
272.12,274.16," tendency, 60 or 70% of"
274.16,276.4," repetitive tendency,"
276.72,276.86, right?
278.02,280.46, So if it's because of the alcohol
280.46,282.18, you don't regret your action at all
282.18,284.16, because you raped the alcohol and nobody
284.16,286.0, blaming the actions and your ability to
286.0,287.66," judge, right? So, which"
287.66,289.92, resulting in more and more numbers of
289.92,291.8, victims being raped after
291.8,294.02, sentencing and after sentencing of
294.02,296.06, offenders and everything. This problem
296.06,298.06, has been so long left in
298.06,299.62, especially in Japanese society and
299.62,302.04," other universities, you know, raping culture society,"
302.16,303.1," right? I'm sorry. So,"
303.36,306.0, we think that's the problem.
306.0,308.0," But more importantly, secondly,"
308.0,310.0, one intoxication defense is illegitimate
310.0,312.0, and should be abolished.
312.0,314.0, So we think that this is an illegitimate
314.0,316.0, formal defense that is more a banger.
316.0,318.0, So first reason is because
318.0,320.0," as I stated,"
320.0,322.0, it's your choice to
322.0,324.0, choose to drink and choose to
324.0,333.88," maybe prescribe, pre to maybe prescribe the medicine in a situation"
333.88,336.12, where you might do something wrong.
336.12,341.6," So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments"
341.6,345.12," and it's probably your choice also, right?"
345.34,350.66," So meaning that, even if you do things while you're being drunk, at the point in which"
350.66,355.16," you choose to drink and to actually go into the society knowing that you might be humble,"
355.48,359.54," we think this person should be fully responsible for their actions, right?"
359.8,364.74," It's totally different from, for example, insanity defense, where people don't choose"
364.74,367.7," to be a mental illness or cannot really control themselves,"
367.7,375.2," but it's rather the way that you choose to drink, right?"
375.2,392.84," So it's a matter of moving to the drink-drunk driving, where you probably drink and you drive and you're punished, right? Even if you have lost your judgement, that doesn't mean that you are not responsible for action."
392.84,394.84," You should be punished equally, right?"
394.84,397.28, So why is this important at the end of the day?
397.28,403.6," We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the beauty of justice for victims, right?"
403.6,407.0, Victims don't care why you started drinking or
407.0,414.0," started, you know, you lost your judgement ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which"
414.0,421.0," those are the ones who didn't choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example. And like, we think that's,"
421.0,425.38," for that sense, we think intoxication defence is immoral as a defence"
425.38,428.54, and should not be really justified and for that reason I'm very happy to propose.
442.92,473.0," I'd like to call on for their speech now about leader opposition So before we move to my substance, I have several questions about that."
473.0,478.0," First of all, we are debating on the existence of concept about intoxication defense."
478.0,489.84," We are not saying sentences for people who have committed crime, when they are drunk, should be always mitigated in regardless of context. This is like any other existing defense, like insanity defense, when perpetrators"
489.84,494.62," submit insanity defense as a case to ask for mitigation, there will be careful discussion"
494.62,498.78, about whether or not they actually don't have responsibility. If the court believes the
498.78,502.58," application of that defense is good, maybe it will be applied. If the court doesn't think"
502.58,509.0," it should be applied, it will not be applied. They cannot simply win this debate by throwing random examples"
509.0,514.14," which sound bad. And second of all, we don't oppose regulations to prohibit actions when"
514.14,518.74," people, for example, drunk driving is prohibited. We are supporting that regulation as well."
518.74,523.38, There is an expected consequence of it. That's why we are regulating drunk driving or some
523.38,525.0, other actions when people are drunk. We will support it. We's why we are regulating drunk driving or some other actions when people
525.0,529.0," are drunk, we will support it. We claim the responsibility to not respect that"
529.0,536.0," negation, but we are saying the consequences caused by being drunk or other substances"
536.0,540.0," should be mitigated compared to other, for example, general murders, general damage"
540.0,544.0," from individuals, and substance from other items. So from a little bit of opportunity,"
544.0,547.14, I want to talk about two things first of all why do you know justice
547.14,551.46, should maintain intoxication defense principally and I will secondly deep dive
551.46,557.52, for specific cases why is this why is no reasonable to abolish intoxication
557.52,561.06, defense and your center house application you know before that several
561.06,565.0, on the independent report also to the Prime Minister.
565.0,569.1," So, first of all, they provided cases about rape, right, repeatedly."
569.1,571.32, I don't say it's completely irrelevant at all.
571.32,573.1," But probably regarding rape cases,"
573.1,575.96," are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense, but"
575.96,579.32," in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of"
579.32,583.16," sentences for rape are generally, generally very low."
583.16,586.5, Those kind of issues are constantly discussed in the current context.
586.5,591.5," We say, when they're talking about rape is very lightly treated, it's not about this debate."
591.5,598.5," They want to, they need to talk about it in other debates. And secondly, they are talking about victims, right?"
598.5,603.5," Criminal case, victims are victims, right, are respected in the status quo."
603.5,609.1," But criminal cases don't respect victims' right to much extent, unfortunately, as a system."
609.4,612.68," Victims' voices are hard as one evidence to discuss culpability,"
613.06,617.44, but victims' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be hard already in the status quo.
617.44,621.5," If you want to argue some compensation things for the levels of rape victims,"
621.7,624.94, it will be another debate about intersexual defense in civil cases.
625.0,627.0, That will be a completely different debate.
627.0,632.0," Then also it's the same for insanity defense. Victims don't care if the people have mental illness or so,"
632.0,638.0, but still insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator's right
638.0,649.5, and prosecute individual in the fair and honest. That's the core principle of criminal justice system. So let's move on to my first point about principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication
649.5,656.0, defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the
656.0,661.0," prosecutor individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice"
661.0,668.0, system is built on a trust of citizen. Every single individual should feel it's a fair jurisdiction under equality of law.
668.0,674.0," That's why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law, if people feel it's not fair,"
674.0,679.0," I don't have any responsibility for this particular crime, that criminal justice system cannot work in the first place."
679.0,695.0," And secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of individuals to a great extent, which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for the consequences caused by the person without any doubt."
695.0,700.0, That's why we assume presumption of innocence in order to protect the right of individuals who commit a crime.
700.0,708.1," That's why we put a burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors, not on the side of defendants."
708.42,711.72, So that should be consistently working in a status quo.
711.96,716.54, That's why I think intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house.
716.54,721.52, Then let's move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained.
721.88,728.0," So for example, taking alcohol and other intoxicants substances are often times inevitable."
728.0,733.0," For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it's really inevitable to go out drinking with customers."
733.0,741.0," It's not limited to alcohol, for example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things"
741.0,749.0," which they can do in a very ordinary situation. For example, you may receive the camphor as a drug for influenza,"
749.0,755.2," but in those circumstances, patients don't have any ways to avoid taking those medicines,"
755.2,760.2, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their cyber house.
760.2,766.08," But in their circumstances, they will abolish every single intoxication defense, the people"
766.08,771.14," who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances, and the people who commit"
771.14,775.94," a murder when they take the time before, are going to be prosecuted in the same way in"
775.94,776.94, their cyber house.
776.94,781.8," That is similarly harmful in terms of fairness for individuals who don't feel like, I'm"
781.8,786.56, fairly treated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons.
786.56,790.16, That's why we think that should stand before moving on here.
790.16,797.04," Okay, TamiFo is taken in the case of the influenza, right? You choose to go outside being severely ill,"
797.04,806.5, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the complete harm of big red victims in Britain.
806.5,810.5, I don't understand your point of information. Taking time for is also the realm of this debate.
810.5,817.0," We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicant circumstances."
817.0,823.5, They need to defend why people who are under the rule need to be prosecuted in the same way
823.5,826.0, compared to other people in ordinary circumstances.
826.0,827.5, So why is this analysis important?
827.5,832.8, Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defence from insanity defence in their cyber house
832.8,836.0, was that a person didn't choose to be in that situation.
836.0,841.0," But in many circumstances, even about alcohol and other toxic circumstances,"
841.0,843.0, a person didn't choose to be in that situation.
843.0,847.8," For example, they don't choose to be full, they don't choose to be going drinking with customers, that will be"
847.8,851.66," the order from, for example, the boss, that is not a controllable"
851.66,856.02," consequences for individual, that's why they are mainly distinguished, the intoxication"
856.02,859.06, defense from other defenses are already not standing in the outside of the house.
859.06,868.0," And also we told you, how many times we have, so that's important. And also we told you in those circumstances,"
868.0,875.0," for example, customers are punched by those sales reps, don't care whether people are drunk or not."
875.0,880.0," But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for that consequence is"
880.0,885.06, severely different from people who are doing the same thing in the ordinary circumstances.
885.4,888.8, We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility.
889.02,891.08," There will be sentences anyway in our cyber house,"
891.24,895.9, but we say there is a slight difference over the responsibility that the individual can take.
895.9,900.28, That should be affecting the sentences the individual will receive in our cyber house.
900.36,976.0," For all these reasons, we are very proud of this. have followed these in their big raptures. I thank the Leader of Opposition, now I'll call on Deputy Prime Minister. All right. Thank you. It was interesting when the Leader of Opposition tells us that on his last minute of speech"
976.0,978.46, that there are cases when drinking is inevitable.
978.46,983.22," You're being coerced by your boss to drink in order to increase your sales revenue, etc."
983.52,986.96," On the other hand, he also told us, look, there's going to be a punishment anyway."
987.26,988.6, There are certain rooms where they think
988.6,990.86, they are responsible for the inevitable action
990.86,991.96," ordered by the boss,"
992.08,993.76, which is massively contradictory.
994.02,995.76," They have agreed that there are cases,"
995.96,997.52," well, I mean, in their cases specifically,"
997.66,998.64," in their favorite cases,"
998.92,1000.1," that even in inevitable cases,"
1000.38,1001.38, there are rooms where those people
1001.38,1003.14, are responsible for their actions.
1003.3,1004.66, What we argue from our proposition
1004.66,1008.4," is that their case, what they tell is not ineptible in any way,"
1008.4,1015.18," but even if they are ineptible, they already made a massive concession by the side that they should take responsibility on their ineptible cases."
1015.18,1020.96," We don't really understand why. They're like 20% it was possible for me to reduce it, but 80% was, you're coerced,"
1020.96,1024.94, but still it's responsible by yourself. They have to deserve it. We think that is wrong.
1024.94,1026.24, I'll talk about two things.
1026.4,1027.14," I'll talk about, firstly,"
1027.96,1029.94," a brief idea, a rebuttal idea about this."
1030.16,1032.32, Rape cases and the idea of
1032.32,1034.52, the medicine side effect.
1034.64,1036.26," And secondly, why even in their"
1036.26,1038.08," case, in their favor,"
1038.22,1040.1," when we talk about this medicine or a customer cell,"
1040.36,1042.2, why we think those people are still responsible
1042.2,1043.98, and should not deserve intoxication
1043.98,1046.04," defense. So firstly,"
1046.5,1047.66, what are the cases we're talking about?
1047.98,1050.12, The first case we have told you that
1050.12,1052.06, there are the problems of understanding
1052.06,1054.1," of gender problems, like rape cases"
1054.1,1056.04, for example. What we've told from the position
1056.04,1057.8, that rape is not only a problem about
1057.8,1060.1," intoxication defence, but there are other things"
1060.1,1061.96, that also evolve when we talk about gender biases
1061.96,1064.18," etc. We don't deny that, maybe that is a problem"
1064.18,1065.78," we also have fixed. But also what we have conceded, had a concession from our position is that he didn Bob, when we talk about gender biases, etc. We don't deny that. Maybe that is a problem we also have fixed. But also,"
1065.9,1067.82," what we have conceded, had a concession from"
1067.82,1069.92," opposition, is that he didn't deny this idea"
1069.92,1071.94, of gender intoxication and defamation is
1071.94,1073.96, one part of the big problem that is associated
1073.96,1075.8, by getting a verdict to defend it
1075.8,1078.02," already, etc. The problem we have"
1078.02,1079.5," is that there are people who say,"
1079.68,1081.76," that person was drunk, so he raised a human"
1081.76,1083.74," to deserve punishment, but still he deserves"
1083.74,1087.2," a less punishment, a mandatory factor, because it wasn't for himself."
1087.2,1090.52, When we talk about boss requesting employees
1090.52,1092.36," to keep drinking for increasing sales salary,"
1092.36,1094.72," he said, well, I'm forcing him to drink a lot"
1094.72,1096.08," in order to increase sales revenue,"
1096.08,1098.72, but part of it is something mandatory.
1098.72,1101.04, Then he can go and receive a certain less punishment
1101.04,1102.64, than he actually deserves.
1102.64,1104.2," We don't really care, keep going on."
1104.2,1108.5, That is a problem we want to fix. We want people to be responsible by saying even
1108.5,1111.88," though you were drunk at some point, it was you who made a decision to"
1111.88,1115.6," keep drinking, right, in order to increase ourselves revenue. It was your choice to"
1115.6,1118.9, go outside when you're drinking a medicine that has a strong side effect without
1118.9,1122.5," having any protection by your family members or any other person, people, or"
1122.5,1130.5," any provider from the state, right. We think those people should be responsible for being a condition that they become drunk or they become addicted by drugs, etc."
1130.5,1136.74," That is the problem we want to fix. And we have to realise, all this problem of, we're not saying victim can make a sentence, right?"
1136.74,1138.66," That's not what we want to say from Prime Minister, right?"
1138.66,1143.56, What we want to say is that victims should receive a certain level of punishment that they deserve through the criminal.
1143.56,1148.32, We think that is something justifiable. What we're saying is that the criminal defendant should
1148.32,1152.0," receive a proportionate punishment that is justified to have, and what we're saying is"
1152.0,1156.12," that it is necessary for the retribution, for the rehabilitation, etc. Meaning, we think"
1156.12,1160.54, it is necessary to give enough punishment. We think that action of being drunk is something
1160.54,1166.02," that deserves punishment, does not deserve any criminal defense, intoxication defense in any case."
1166.36,1171.32," So second, let's talk about the most plausible case for opposition, what they have told us."
1171.5,1177.68," So they told us, their stance was, there are some cases where this intoxication defense may function, right?"
1177.88,1184.74," Well, that's true, but at least we want to hear from them, what are the cases, are there some cases that this intoxication defense is sometimes necessary, right?"
1184.9,1188.66," Unless they're going to do that, I'm just going to say it's sometimes necessary without knowing when it is."
1188.9,1192.18," Then the first case we heard was, look, it's about medicine that has side effects."
1192.48,1196.12," We agree that being a disease, there are cases when it wasn't your fault, right?"
1196.3,1198.84, That maybe your body wasn't functioning properly and got a disease.
1198.9,1199.32, That's true.
1199.36,1200.24, And you had to drink a medicine.
1200.58,1201.0, That's true.
1201.22,1203.62," What we have to recognize, as we have talked to from prime minister,"
1203.78,1206.02, is that if you got drunk and you know that
1206.02,1208.14," you have a strong side effect, as we explained by a doctor"
1208.14,1210.08, that you have a strong side effect and sometimes you lose
1210.08,1212.08," conscious maybe, you have to ask someone"
1212.08,1214.12," else's help, right? Because the entire"
1214.12,1216.1, society is not consenting of
1216.1,1218.08, you walking out with losing your
1218.08,1220.4, control maybe by the
1220.4,1222.1, effect of side effect. Other people
1222.1,1224.32, are not consenting to receive a possible harm
1224.32,1225.62," by your actions,"
1225.62,1228.22, we don't think other people should be blamed on that point.
1228.22,1230.78," What we want to blame for those victims, the criminals,"
1230.78,1233.56, is that it was you who knew that a drug could give
1233.56,1234.94, a side effect at that point.
1234.94,1236.9," You should have asked, and you could have asked,"
1236.9,1238.0, a help to other people.
1238.0,1239.66, You could have asked your mom to lock up the door
1239.66,1241.18, so you don't have to go outside
1241.18,1242.94," and keep bullying other people, for example."
1242.94,1248.04," You could have had help of your mother or grandfather, any other family members, to be with you when you have to go outside or keep bullying other people for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather or any other family members to be with you when you have to go"
1248.04,1252.12, outside to a supermarket to buy a drug for example. So that person can control you when
1252.12,1256.5, you have used a conscience and may start attacking someone else. There are lots of options that
1256.5,1260.64, a person could have taken. A person has actually negligence and say I'm not going to take any
1260.64,1264.62, of those options and they're just going to go out because I want to. And I think actually
1264.62,1268.0, forgiving a part of it because you because it was a side effect.
1268.0,1272.0, I couldn't do anything about it even though that person could have done a lot of things to prevent it.
1272.0,1276.0, That person didn't do it. They think that person deserves the punishment at that point.
1276.0,1282.0, Your logic was people should be punished without any defenses because you made some decisions that caused crimes in the end.
1282.0,1285.38, Why don't you maintain insanity defense inciting effects? Because mentally ill people
1285.38,1286.62, chose to go outside
1286.62,1287.58, which caused crimes.
1288.12,1288.28," Well,"
1288.36,1289.28," the distinction here is right,"
1289.34,1290.64," this is the distinction, right?"
1290.8,1290.98," So,"
1291.18,1292.52," when a mentally ill person,"
1292.56,1292.7," right,"
1292.74,1293.6, decided that that person
1293.6,1294.52," is going to go out,"
1294.72,1295.2," that person,"
1295.54,1297.22," already before going out,"
1297.36,1298.42, does not have a full capability
1298.42,1299.04, of deciding
1299.04,1299.88, what's going to happen
1299.88,1300.78, when they go outside.
1300.96,1301.7," Or what are the other,"
1301.7,1302.04," like,"
1302.24,1303.0, viable alternatives
1303.0,1304.34, that that person could take
1304.34,1305.2, in order to prevent
1305.2,1306.96, all the possible harm to that person?
1306.96,1308.4, That's the distinction.
1308.4,1310.44," Before people become drunk, they're not drunk."
1310.44,1312.08," Obviously, they have certain constraints"
1312.08,1312.92, that are controlled by them.
1312.92,1315.48, So that's the distinction between insanity defense
1315.48,1317.84, or target of people who are mentally ill.
1317.84,1320.4," Second case was, look, other plausible case was,"
1320.4,1321.76, the boss is going to force them
1321.76,1322.96, so they have to drink.
1322.96,1325.98," Firstly, requirement from the boss isn't absolute."
1325.98,1328.56," If you're going to deny, it's not like you're going to be killed."
1328.56,1330.06, There are a couple of options you can take.
1330.06,1331.82," One worst case scenario, just quit."
1331.82,1334.1," Second option, just go to a harassment center or whatever,"
1334.1,1335.62, just to claim your boss that you're being coerced
1335.62,1337.76, to do all this alcohol harassment whatsoever.
1337.76,1340.12," We think that person are more likely to be told,"
1340.12,1342.5, you should not coerce your employees to drink too much.
1342.5,1343.86," With that person, you're going to be switched"
1343.86,1347.26, because there are lots of problems that are associated with harassment and compliance
1347.26,1350.46," that are associated in any other country of Western world democracy, including Japan,"
1350.46,1353.0," that it's a wrong thing to keep doing all this harassment,"
1353.0,1354.68, and we should be nice to those employers.
1354.68,1356.16, We think that very functioned as well.
1356.16,1358.44, There are lots of options that a person can take.
1358.44,1360.1," And moreover, if that's necessary,"
1360.1,1363.28," we think that boss should also be coerced into punishment, etc."
1363.28,1366.08, That person is making those employees lose control
1366.08,1367.16, by the coercive orders.
1367.38,1371.34, There are lots of options that customers or employees can take.
1371.52,1373.22," Obviously, it was not inevitable."
1373.58,1374.76, It was your choice.
1374.94,1375.58," And more than that,"
1375.58,1377.98, that person didn't have to keep drinking forever.
1378.44,1380.82, We have to realize that all these problems often happen
1380.82,1383.24, when these individuals drink often too much
1383.24,1386.0, over their capacities that they cannot control anymore.
1386.0,1391.0," They also had an ability to control how much they can drink in the vast majority of cases, but they didn't do that."
1391.0,1397.0," They have realised, what the boss told me to do is drink a far lower capacity than I can have in order to create all the problems."
1397.0,1403.0, We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control in their mind but they didn't choose to and therefore those people deserve punishment.
1403.0,1408.0," That's why in vast any cases, intoxication defence should not be allowed. It was your fault, you deserve"
1408.0,1410.0, punishment. That's the request.
1424.0,1449.0, I thank Deputy Prime Minister for her speech and I call upon the Deputy Leader of Opposition. Two clarification before we move on to speech.
1449.0,1452.0," First of all, that's the, and so what they have tried to,"
1452.0,1456.0, their burden of proof is that they are opposing the entire concept of that
1456.0,1458.0, intoxication of defense itself.
1458.0,1461.0," So that's the students, because the government side have to need to decide any"
1461.0,1467.0," cases that the white students need to not necessarily to consider about in not necessarily consider about the intoxication of defence,"
1467.0,1472.0," even if there is certain possibility of existence, obviously they cannot control themselves with this kind of appreciation."
1472.0,1479.0," Rather, they can provide proof to us why students in any case do not necessarily have the concept of this type of defence."
1479.0,1485.3, The second point is that we do not have a responsibility to this person completely
1485.3,1489.0, that's any no responsibility about committing crime.
1489.0,1494.0," Obviously we are more happy to consider the extent, to what extent they cannot control themselves,"
1494.0,1498.0," the understanding of things, or for the most part we are more happy to consider"
1498.0,1502.0," whether or not they can avoid becoming intoxicated or not,"
1502.0,1505.88," to what extent the harassment by the boss,"
1505.88,1509.24," or to an extent, they can avoid taking medicine."
1509.24,1510.88," They can say, we are also happy to also"
1510.88,1512.84, constrain this kind of situation.
1512.84,1516.26, So that clarification from the boss.
1516.26,1517.26, So I have that.
1518.46,1520.76," Okay, simple, one question."
1520.76,1522.76," The first one, whether or not we can"
1530.0,1533.0," ask the responsibility to this person who is already becoming intoxication. Before moving on, that's the two points of response."
1533.0,1537.0," So they're talking about, they're continuously talking about that the student becomes an existence of rape,"
1537.0,1542.0," problematic people, and abusing that this defense is, and then repeating again and again."
1542.0,1547.26, It's obviously that's out of the TV maybe this is a problem I think I see for
1547.26,1551.0, actually the intention of committing crime I mean I mean I'm using the
1551.0,1554.94, disciples of defense people are happy to also consider the dish Asia so we are
1554.94,1558.36, seeing this people that are using all day of the sudden consciousness people
1558.36,1562.2, happy to punish them it's obviously not the different debate what is the debate
1562.2,1571.0, is our weekend just a lot the people who became into the international situation can have been just taking the responsibility about their action or not.
1571.0,1577.0," For example, they're talking about, the first speaker is talking about like the rape culture, etc. Two responses here."
1577.0,1585.84," The first one was fundamentally it's also nothing to do with the, the this motion based on the, it's obviously that different with that principle level. For the moment we think that the rape culture is obviously"
1585.84,1588.74, the relative with the phaser of the court making
1588.74,1590.4, particular decision making or not.
1590.4,1592.98," So even if that, even if it's so significant"
1592.98,1595.9," with that related with, and also after this system,"
1595.9,1598.0, people recognizing that the responsibility
1598.0,1600.48," or the situation in the toxination,"
1600.48,1602.56," it's rather counterproductive, I think."
1602.56,1604.24," Because if the last people that,"
1604.24,1606.0," even if you are becoming intoxicated,"
1606.0,1610.0," you have to take responsibility, rather the victim is a break."
1610.0,1612.0," For example, the majority of the cases of rape culture,"
1612.0,1615.0, is that the responsibility of the victim.
1615.0,1619.0," Even if you drink so much, but you are in a toxic situation,"
1619.0,1621.0," you have to take responsibility, etc."
1621.0,1632.0," So that's the situation, it's rather counterproductive to enhancing enhancing rape culture but it's not so much related to this motion anyway so okay that's the only way that it's"
1632.0,1638.56, counterproductive it's not so much important okay so um okay let's move on to the first issue
1638.56,1648.0, uh my issue the phaser not weak and that's uh uh there's a whether or not this people have a responsibility in the intoxication situation.
1648.0,1654.0," So, we think that generally that these people cannot avoid and cannot control themselves,"
1654.0,1658.0, and actually they committing crime because in the situation that the intoxication.
1658.0,1663.0," So, two layer of analysis. First of all, before they becoming that intoxication,"
1663.0,1667.0, whether or not they can that to become intoxicated or not.
1667.0,1677.0," So, we think that, as my partner already told you, it's obviously inevitable to become intoxicated."
1677.0,1682.0," For example, taking medicine or certain pressure from the boss's existence."
1682.0,1685.44," They don't just quit or just control themselves, etc."
1685.44,1690.24," So first of all, as I already mentioned, we were also happy to consider that to what extent"
1690.24,1696.48, this pressure is so huge or not. So that we still recognize that even the power harassment
1696.48,1701.36," is recognized, or sexual harassment is problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it. Some"
1701.36,1706.48," people are forced to do particular action. So on that occasion, we also postulate that fact."
1706.48,1710.1," For example, they talking about the preemptive measure,"
1710.1,1712.54," they do not want to outside, et cetera."
1712.54,1713.38, Two responses here.
1713.38,1718.38, The first one is from the perspective of the individual
1718.46,1720.58," who gradually becoming intoxication,"
1720.58,1722.94, it's extremely difficult to understand
1722.94,1728.0," to what extent I am rational, to what extent I am becoming intoxicated, etc."
1728.0,1731.0, Even taking drugs or even taking alcohol.
1731.0,1735.0," So on the occasion, even still, they believe in us."
1735.0,1737.0, Maybe I can turn into them rationally.
1737.0,1741.0," Maybe I do not commit crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation."
1741.0,1745.6," So on the occasion, they easily do that to understand whether I'm rational or not,"
1745.6,1750.24," but still they need to keep their original rights. They need to, for example, even take drugs,"
1750.24,1756.16," they go to the supermarket or some situation. So on that, some believe, maybe I'm not so much,"
1756.88,1760.96," maybe I'm not so much satirical, I have a rationality, I'm not committing crime,"
1760.96,1767.34," etc. And they're going to do so., actually it's obviously not so much easy to take"
1767.34,1769.1, into account the measure of the pre-pandemic.
1769.1,1774.6," Ok, if we pass this act, don't you think it's more likely for the workers to avoid the harassment,"
1774.6,1779.1," saying that I will never be mitigated, or those people will be act more responsibly?"
1779.1,1783.5, It's obviously nothing to do with this debate.
1783.5,1786.56," Because if the children children commit more crimes,"
1786.56,1788.84, do we support the child defense?
1788.84,1790.58, Or this kind of idea?
1790.58,1792.08, The obvious thing is that whether or not people
1792.08,1794.48," commit a crime or not, it's obviously a different debate"
1794.48,1797.08, with whether or not we can give the punishment
1797.08,1798.98," on the people, whether or not we can constrain"
1798.98,1802.34," the punishment, okay, this kind of situation."
1802.34,1804.06," So, okay."
1804.06,1807.76," And also, still they have certain punishment,"
1807.76,1808.84," huge punishment,"
1808.84,1809.7," punishment in existence,"
1809.7,1812.5, obviously that's not workable as they done.
1812.5,1813.34," Second point, I mean,"
1813.34,1816.0, the other day they becoming that intoxication.
1816.0,1817.0," So as I already mentioned that,"
1817.0,1818.92, so that whether or not they are that intoxication
1818.92,1821.72," or not, they extremely that's being that metric."
1821.72,1822.56," For the more you say,"
1822.56,1824.04," if you want to becoming intoxication,"
1824.04,1826.08," you cannot that consider so much. What I mean by this is if you want to become intoxication, you cannot consider so much."
1826.08,1828.5," What I mean by this is that if you become intoxication,"
1828.5,1832.12, you can understand what that linkage is with your action
1832.12,1833.96, and what is the consequence of that.
1833.96,1837.58," So for example, just people who drink too much,"
1837.58,1841.38," so punching something, so they do not understand"
1841.38,1844.42," whether it's damaging this something,"
1844.42,1847.0, or also how to damage themselves.
1847.0,1851.0, People cannot understand the consequences of their actions.
1851.0,1853.0, They can imagine that.
1853.0,1858.0, That's why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people.
1858.0,1862.0, Because they cannot understand what their actions are and what the consequences are.
1862.0,1867.56," It's very similar to same way that child defense or the insanity defense, these kind of things."
1867.56,1871.02, So that's why they do not intentionally
1871.02,1872.38, that they're committing crimes.
1872.38,1875.4, They rather just accidentally committing crimes.
1875.4,1877.72, It's not easy to think that this is a responsibility
1877.72,1878.7, of that person.
1878.7,1880.5," So what I told you, first of all,"
1880.5,1883.3, this is a debate about to what extent
1883.3,1884.6, people have a responsibility.
1884.6,1890.24," The first of all, we's not easy to avoid becoming an intoxication."
1890.24,1893.86," The second one is that after becoming an intoxication,"
1893.86,1895.88, people cannot control themselves.
1895.88,1896.76, That's very simple.
1896.76,1897.92, That's why we propose.
1897.92,1913.0, Thank you.好
1917.0,1919.0,我感謝史蒂芬利的領導和黃鑽
1919.0,1921.0,我的力量是多少
1921.0,1923.0,你自己的力量
1923.0,1926.0,我自己的力量いいんじゃないですか?別にそうじゃないよ頑張れ
1926.0,1928.0,すごい面白い
1928.0,1949.78,いい話だよ Thank you.
1953.84,1958.78," Chair, what makes this debate apparently difficult for the government is that we must defend a rather sweeping policy of not recognising any intoxication defence."
1959.12,1961.84, It might seem that the degree of responsibility differs
1961.84,1966.0, between intoxicated criminals and non-intoxicated criminals.
1966.0,1971.76," So it might seem, according to the opposition, that when it comes to deciding on mitigation,"
1971.76,1975.04," this difference of degrees of responsibility should be taken into account,"
1975.04,1979.6," hence intoxication defence, and the opposition might seem to have a very easy debate here."
1979.6,1985.0, So that's why they even deepened their case beyond safe-call-trusting.
1985.0,1991.0, The government's burden is to show how this sweeping denial of intoxication defence can be successful.
1991.0,1997.0," This burden will be met by how society currently deals with intoxication problems,"
1997.0,2010.32, making individuals informed about the danger of intoxication and making them capable of making decisions upon that intoxication. The way we as a society view substance intoxication and the way we inform people about it justifies
2010.32,2014.88," a special case against intoxication defence sweepingly, and that is the point that I'm"
2014.88,2016.8, going to summarise in this speech.
2016.8,2025.32," So, unfortunately I have only one clash point, which is obviously how we should"
2025.32,2028.84, recognize the differential or degrees of responsibility
2028.84,2031.28, between intoxicated and non-intoxicated criminals.
2031.28,2035.04," So the main point was clear from the leader of opposition,"
2035.04,2038.6, saying that responsibility should be carefully calculated
2038.6,2044.52, in case of criminal cases because public trust in criminal
2044.52,2046.2, justice system is important and because
2046.2,2051.0, rights restrictions should always be carefully justified by case-by-case basis.
2051.0,2056.24," So the first response to this general argument is that this is shallow, I think, but the"
2056.24,2061.44," first response is that if trust matters, then the leader of opposition's rebuttal to our"
2061.44,2065.0, Prime Minister's point about the victim' interest doesn't stand at all.
2065.0,2090.76, Because we generally have doubts on the criminal justice system that continually decrease in terms of imprisonment against this kind of defence.
2090.76,2095.2," And the second response is against their point about rights restrictions,"
2095.2,2098.72, that any rights restriction should be justified adequately.
2098.72,2101.12, And we have no disagreement here.
2101.12,2104.76," The point is, this point is, I think, related to a deeper issue"
2104.76,2105.02," that the opposition side presupposed but not explained, free will or self-control. no disagreement here. The point is, this point is, I think, related to a deeper issue that"
2105.02,2111.52," opposition side presupposed but not explained, free will or self-control. Which we say that"
2111.52,2116.92, the degree of responsibility of one's action should be based upon how much reasonable self-control
2116.92,2121.96," one could have exercised in the process leading to criminal actions, right? So those who lack"
2121.96,2126.26, the ability to act on self-control at any point of that process
2126.26,2131.96, cannot be punished as harshly as those who are self-controlling. That might be the opposite
2131.96,2138.72, case. And now we have to make some differentiation between substance intoxication and non-intoxication.
2139.06,2143.6, So how does substance intoxication differ from other cases of diminution of responsibility?
2144.26,2148.0," So the opposite is preferred analogies, a mental illness or insanity defence,"
2148.0,2154.0," or more specifically, or characteristically for today's options, side effects of medicines."
2154.0,2166.4," Firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one's own self-controlled choice that one entered the gate to intoxication."
2166.74,2172.72," So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction,"
2173.1,2176.2, begins from one's choice in the first place.
2176.42,2181.2," Not only that, the continual substance addiction, or the ongoing process of being addicted,"
2181.66,2186.0," can be avoided, could have been avoided avoided by one's own self-controlled"
2186.0,2191.9," choices, for example going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives"
2191.9,2197.1," or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals and that"
2197.1,2212.12," choice, or that self-controlled choice was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions."
2212.12,2219.44, So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-toxicated defenders' cases.
2219.44,2227.44," So we think this is a massive difference of substance addiction, substance intoxication, from other cases such as mental illnesses,"
2227.58,2231.34, because obviously there's no self-control in the process leading to mental illness
2231.34,2234.54, and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses.
2234.82,2234.96, Yes?
2235.24,2238.02," If your argument is true, do you oppose the distinction between"
2238.02,2240.12, well-planned crimes and composite crimes?
2241.06,2241.54, Sorry?
2242.18,2246.68," So if the fact that you knew it and you opt into it is also a virus, do you oppose the"
2246.68,2250.76, distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes?
2250.76,2255.84," No, we don't have to make that distinction because..."
2255.84,2260.06," Okay, let's talk about the data."
2260.06,2266.22," Okay, let's take the options's preferred cases one by one."
2266.52,2269.9," So this said first, then what about the side effect of medicines?"
2270.48,2275.64," So we think the opposition cannot just throw one possible case of intoxication, right?"
2276.04,2280.86, They must show that such a case is significantly likely to lead to intoxicated criminal actions
2280.86,2284.52," that is totally detached from self-control's decision-making, right?"
2284.52,2290.6," So we think that's a deeper explanation of lacking in the Hoshino's case, despite the fact that"
2290.6,2294.6, they tried to be specific about each case.
2294.6,2298.6," Secondly, they said, then what about being forced by bosses to drink?"
2298.6,2308.0," Asai already responded in his rebuttals, but to put a fundamental point from a criminal policy perspective,"
2308.0,2316.0," we have always warned the public, or cautioned the public, of the dangers of substance intoxication"
2316.0,2328.16," in our daily practices. For example, we campaign against drug violence, those campaign posters against drug violence appear time and again in train"
2328.16,2333.28," stations for example, and anti-drug campaigning exists everywhere, and also tamifu is already"
2333.28,2337.84, known as dangerous enough to distort your calculation.
2337.84,2342.8," So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there"
2342.8,2345.72," was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which"
2345.72,2352.32," people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good"
2352.32,2358.0, basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control.
2358.0,2362.76," Also, the fact that we abolished intoxication defence will enhance our ability to deal with"
2362.76,2369.66, such programmes as forcing and persecution related problems. The point is that the way the society approaches crimes
2369.66,2374.66, expresses the society's view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing
2374.66,2379.6," to drink is dangerous, time reform is dangerous, and all these evaluations to the options proposed"
2379.6,2385.0, problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated on a daily basis.
2385.0,2389.0," And we think these kinds of effects don't exist for mental illness, right?"
2389.0,2392.0, We can't warn people against becoming mentally ill.
2392.0,2395.0, And we think this is a clear distinction.
2395.0,2423.0," Enough? We are done. I think I got my whip secret, I'll go up on opposition whip."
2423.0,2427.0," So it's like three speakers saying the same thing, but it's important once again to know"
2427.0,2431.0, that their verdict is proof that this framework should be abolished.
2431.0,2436.0," Because it's that, we have told you that if there are circumstances in which this could be applied,"
2436.0,2442.0, like in cases where prescribed medicine causes you side effects because you were not feeling well that day
2442.0,2445.86," and you did something terrible, it might be that you have a hard drinking session"
2445.86,2448.0, and you did some terrible thing but it's kind of
2448.0,2449.6," a cultural thing, you know, cooperation that was"
2449.6,2451.94, uneditable for you. Or even if it's your
2451.94,2454.04, active choice and you're just drinking and going on
2454.04,2455.64," with it, these circumstances"
2455.64,2458.0, you are not yourself. You are not really
2458.0,2460.1," remembering it, you don't really think about it"
2460.1,2462.04, and it's that your culpability is
2462.04,2464.06, minimised. We were telling you that
2464.06,2465.44, it might be that in some cases
2465.44,2466.98," they are really responsible,"
2467.3,2469.7, but there are multiple cases where these people
2469.7,2471.62, do not take the reasonable culpability
2471.62,2473.72, as compared to where they were rational
2473.72,2476.62, and not drinking or not being intoxicated by substances.
2476.96,2478.74, I'm telling you that I think that the distinction
2478.74,2480.08, reasonably exists.
2480.42,2481.98, This framework should exist.
2482.26,2484.48," Once again, this circumstantial argument"
2484.48,2485.28," from coming from God,"
2485.28,2491.7," we can deal with them specifically. The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances,"
2491.7,2497.98," and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were causing this situation, because they were telling us that for some"
2498.24,2502.68," minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice."
2502.68,2509.0," I don't think that's how justice should work. Three questions. Firstly, on is this policy beneficial, or is those"
2509.0,2513.84," benefits justified in taking this policy? Secondly, on should the consent on whether"
2513.84,2517.38," you're drunk or not matter in the debate? And thirdly, if I have time, I'll talk about"
2517.38,2522.82," what is important in the criminal justice system. So, rebuttals integrated. So is this"
2522.82,2525.0," policy beneficial, or the benefits justified? So, they may not beneficial or is it justified?"
2525.0,2529.0," So, the main argument is that rape is terrible, we've got to do something, and they're willing"
2529.0,2532.0, to say that rape is so important that they're willing to abolish it if they don't care about
2532.0,2533.0, the trailer.
2533.0,2537.0," One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in"
2537.0,2538.0, addressing the situation.
2538.0,2541.0, We're talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice
2541.0,2544.0," framework, we're talking about investigations and assessing of situations of exceptions"
2544.0,2545.62, in drug cases being highlighted
2545.62,2547.8, as Scandinavian nations taking more hard
2547.8,2550.1, criminal sanctions on rape cases
2550.1,2552.14, where people are doing active things and trying to get away
2552.14,2553.76, with it. These discussions are happening
2553.76,2555.98, and these things are gradually changing. I don't
2555.98,2557.96, necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute
2557.96,2559.76, because if you are able to
2559.76,2561.84, put in specific clauses
2561.84,2563.6, about drunk cases in rape
2563.6,2566.22," situations, then they achieve their goal. They are"
2566.22,2568.4, arguing at best saying that we should abolish
2568.4,2570.26, intoxication defence in rape
2570.26,2572.06, cases and not necessarily supporting the motion.
2572.18,2574.32," Because if it takes the alternative, you don't have to"
2574.32,2576.36," take all, to sacrifice all the"
2576.36,2578.28," alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked"
2578.28,2579.96," about, people who are intoxicated by the"
2579.96,2581.76," time of war and things, and get all their benefits."
2581.94,2583.72, So I don't know why they're willing to get the trade-off.
2583.88,2585.82," But even if we concede that they can get the benefit,"
2586.12,2588.08, we argue that criminal justice is about
2588.08,2590.12, inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation.
2590.48,2592.0," So ultimately, your attempt"
2592.0,2593.76, to prioritize one specific case for the
2593.76,2595.9, sake of sacrificing other
2595.9,2597.82, considerations and other situations is against
2597.82,2599.48, the basic framework of criminal justice.
2599.7,2601.76, You're abandoning the attempt to be proportionate
2601.76,2603.88, and inclusive of a variety of situations and considerations
2603.88,2606.3, that are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was
2606.3,2610.44, the clearest substantive from the leader of an opposition. But another even-in-case is that
2610.44,2614.94," if the point of justice is so distorted by offensive or racial, patriarchal"
2614.94,2618.9," justice and things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help"
2618.9,2622.16, because it's still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and
2622.16,2630.18," things going on there and you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved."
2630.76,2636.86, They also said that victims are offended by the attempts to prove that they're not really
2636.86,2640.08," guilty, and that kind of victim sentiment is something that should matter."
2640.44,2644.6," We don't think that it's important, because they have not responded to our legal options"
2644.6,2648.44," to stand about how victims' emotions are not considered criminal justice, which is"
2648.44,2652.86," a factual thing. But also importantly, their argument is invalid because if their argument"
2652.86,2657.4," is true, they are saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting"
2657.4,2661.96, to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defence would also keep discussing
2661.96,2667.56," the victim and that clause of insanity defence ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they"
2667.56,2670.74," had to do this kind of thing, made it disgusting to the victim, so they were willing to abolish"
2670.74,2675.34," that. But that's not how they made the principle of distinction. I don't think that's how,"
2675.52,2679.7," obviously, it should work. So why we think that argument, even if it's beneficial, does"
2679.7,2684.02, not justify taking this policy. So thank you. The last practical thing they said was that
2684.02,2685.86," crimes increase, we won't deter."
2686.16,2687.92," We think, obviously, you know,"
2688.0,2689.92, it's this that a 10-year sentence
2689.92,2691.9, might become an 8-year sentence
2691.9,2693.52, with the existence of this defense.
2693.72,2695.02, You have the social sanctions
2695.02,2696.6, and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it.
2696.8,2698.7, I don't think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate.
2698.92,2700.96, But also deterrence is just one part of the clause.
2701.16,2702.9," So if deterrence is important in that specific case,"
2703.02,2704.16, we might increase the punishment.
2704.16,2707.98, But there's not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent
2707.98,2711.72," power clause that exists in the criminal justice system, so I don't know why abolishing makes"
2711.72,2712.02, sense.
2712.4,2712.6, Sure.
2713.94,2714.54," Wait, hold on."
2715.88,2720.96," On to your PO, in your planned and compulsive crime distinction, the intoxication crime"
2720.96,2724.24," is willful on the side closer to planned murder, for example."
2724.64,2725.52, We think think because...
2725.52,2726.84, I won't talk about that.
2727.68,2731.82," We think intoxication climate is akin to willful negligence, if all others is also."
2732.36,2733.64," Okay, let me deal with that."
2733.88,2735.06," So, second question."
2735.24,2737.58, Should the choice of you drinking matter that much?
2737.62,2741.44," Because the principal argument coming a bit from off, from Gov,"
2741.48,2743.54," is that you're drunk, you're aware of it,"
2743.6,2750.94," so you should take the responsibility and just face it. That is not really important, because firstly, I think they have no response"
2750.94,2755.06," to our argument from the leader of our opposition and the deputy, talking about our culpabilities"
2755.06,2759.44," at the core of the criminal justice system, where to the extent that you are trying to"
2759.44,2762.92," impose sanctions on individuals, and to the extent that we consider fairness as important,"
2763.26,2769.2, we need a reasonable accusation and grounds that these people are responsible for their acts to impose any punishment
2769.2,2771.54, on these individuals and by assumption of innocent exit.
2771.96,2775.5," Obviously, these individuals, because they were not necessarily themselves when they"
2775.5,2776.86," were drowned, they don't remember it."
2776.94,2782.72," They usually wouldn't do that, which means that the extent that they take responsibility"
2782.72,2786.5," for their acts is decreased and to the extent that even if we agree to that,"
2786.5,2790.5," there's a different parallel reason to consider that they should be decreased of their punishment,"
2790.5,2795.0, and why that doesn't really prove any validity in this debate.
2795.0,2800.0," But also importantly, they say that insanity is okay, but drunk is bad."
2800.0,2805.34," We think that's a bad argument, because essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally"
2805.34,2809.62, vulnerable and you can't think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally
2809.62,2814.24, ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational or
2814.24,2817.54, they are not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances.
2817.86,2822.48, Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take choice
2822.48,2825.9, of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware
2825.9,2827.68, of the risk that they might go kind of
2827.68,2829.98, mentally unstable and do these acts and they're not
2829.98,2832.1, willing to impose on these individuals and understand
2832.1,2833.86, the distinction. And the last point about
2833.86,2836.18, planned crimes and
2836.18,2837.8, composite crimes
2837.8,2839.86, that's important because their argument
2839.86,2841.82, is technically saying that you drank
2841.82,2844.14, and you chose that should take the full responsibility
2844.14,2846.68, distinct from other people that are rational.
2846.68,2850.86," Meaning that if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the"
2850.86,2855.18, responsibility. Meaning that if you opt into it and know that you would opt into a
2855.18,2859.08," framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that's technically saying that"
2859.08,2864.0, the well planned crime which you opt into fully and the compulsive crime which you have been compulsively
2864.0,2868.3, obtained have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that and why you think that.
2868.3,2870.3, It doesn't matter and it doesn't make sense to take this poll.
2879.8,2885.0, I thank the opposition from Sikar now that the opposition replies to me.
2890.0,2898.0," So, sure. Let's make this debate very simple, because there are many trivial disputes which are actually not the core of this debate."
2898.0,2904.0," For example, sales forces can avoid drinking, they can quit, they can sue lawsuits for harassment."
2904.0,2907.44," Actually, that's not important, even though that's a case coming from outside of the house."
2907.44,2913.36, What we need to talk about here is that there is some differences of gravity of responsibility
2913.36,2919.12, between these sales forces punching someone and clearly conscious people punching someone
2919.12,2927.04," intentionally. That will be, maybe it's right, but there will be some differences between people who are drunk and people who are not drunk."
2927.4,2931.06, They may have succeeded in explaining the difference is not that big.
2931.38,2932.74," Yeah, they could explain that."
2933.0,2934.54, Maybe the difference is not that big.
2934.96,2939.58," People chose to be drunk, people chose to go drinking, that will be the choice of individual."
2939.98,2943.96, That's why maybe the difference is not as big as we told you from the beginning.
2943.96,2948.54," But the thing is, they couldn't prove there should be no differences of treatment for"
2948.54,2951.06, individuals who are Trump and who are never Trump and
2951.06,2954.66," who are consciously killing someone, consciously punching someone."
2955.76,2960.24, So maybe that will already show how we run this debate.
2960.24,2964.44, But I want to talk about some other opposition government's principle and
2964.44,2968.0, I want to clarify why we clearly took this event.
2968.0,2971.0, So the best principle coming from their side of the house was that
2971.0,2975.0," people made a decision to pass the gate that will be connected to crimes,"
2975.0,2981.0, and they are informed of the risk that their action will ultimately lead to some consequences.
2981.0,2986.98," Okay, let's look at non-tokushxicated criminals. So they chose to go outside consciously,"
2987.22,2990.88," they chose to buy a knife consciously, they chose to meet the person they hate consciously,"
2991.26,2997.4," they chose to stab someone, that person consciously, they chose not to call ambulances consciously,"
2997.66,3002.16," everything was conscious in that case. But conversely, how about intoxicated individuals?"
3002.82,3007.5," They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but"
3007.5,3010.86," they chose to drink a lot, that would be a conscious choice of individual."
3010.86,3015.38," They may be aware of some risk at this point, but they didn't choose to buy a knife, they"
3015.38,3020.38," didn't choose to meet a person that they somehow hate, they didn't choose to stab a knife into"
3020.38,3026.0," a person, maybe they even don't remember everything after they actually went drunk."
3026.0,3033.0," So, toxicated criminals are still very bad people, that's also murder, but they should be sentenced"
3033.0,3039.0, according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be
3039.0,3045.54," the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate, or those kind of expected risk is very different"
3045.54,3048.2," from cases where individuals are very conscious,"
3048.56,3050.92," very have clear mind to kill someone,"
3051.2,3052.56, there will be some differences.
3053.04,3056.0, Then let's go back to the bottom group of outsider house.
3056.18,3058.2, We are talking about we should maintain
3058.2,3061.38, the intoxication defense in the outsider house.
3061.38,3064.38, We are not saying people should be mitigated
3064.98,3066.0, in every circumstances. What they have are not saying people should be mitigated in every circumstances.
3066.0,3071.0," What they have to prove is there should be no kind of intoxication defense, people should"
3071.0,3077.0," be sentenced equally in every circumstances, even though they have some tiny responsibility"
3077.0,3085.28, compared between individuals who are very conscious and people who are not conscious even though they chose to be
3085.28,3093.98, Trump. So that's why I'm a sure person. So I think I've made one mistake already.
3093.98,3099.92, They couldn't do. There is no any tiny difference between people who chose to
3099.92,3103.68, think and who didn't choose to kill someone and people who are conscious about
3103.68,3111.0, everything. There will be some differences. That's why that difference should be reflected in the
3111.0,3117.5," sentences that should be given to individuals, because that should be the more equal treatment"
3117.5,3123.5," for individuals who are in different situations, and that will be a more trustable system that"
3123.5,3126.84," we can rely on. For those reasons you who are listening, I'm very proud of those."
3126.84,3133.84, .
3133.84,3135.28," Oh, sorry."
3135.28,3142.36, .
3142.36,3147.0," I thank the reply speaker, and I will applaud the government replied speaker."
3154.0,3159.0," Thank you, Chair. We believe there are two main periods that do their case in this debate."
3159.0,3163.0, The first mistake they have made is that the line they draw on intoxication in Newfans
3163.0,3167.0, is so blurred to an extent that it sounds almost contradictory.
3167.0,3174.0," At the point in which Mizogami-san said, while you are drunk, you don't remember anything, and you are basically a different person."
3174.0,3178.0," Then why and on what ground you are punishing the person even, right?"
3178.0,3189.48," Because if you think that being drunk is so big of a deal, to the extent that you don't remember anything, then probably you should not punish this individual at all. But the important point is that you"
3189.48,3194.42," didn't provide the reason as to why you can punish, and draw the line as to why that's"
3194.42,3198.86," legitimate, right? But second mistake that they made is that despite the fact that they"
3198.86,3206.92," keep claiming that there are some cases we should consider, they never really proved the equivalent to us, how that"
3206.92,3213.0, case is important to the extent that we should remain this framework. Because the three
3213.0,3217.2," thoughts that they've given us is probably like, you know, taking Tamifu without guardian"
3217.2,3223.32," and, you know, the consequence of that. And the consequence is what, right? We don't see"
3223.32,3226.72," the impact, and you didn't really ground the impact as to why taking time"
3226.72,3228.12," and going out and do something,"
3228.12,3231.66," and your punish is such a culpable thing,"
3231.66,3234.0," and we think that circumstance,"
3234.0,3235.88," even if we keep the trade-off thing,"
3235.88,3238.06, we think we are actually winning this debate.
3238.06,3240.16," But moving on to my issue, which is about"
3240.16,3242.42," is intoxication defense legitimate,"
3242.42,3243.86, based on three criteria.
3244.76,3246.74, I'll talk to you about this.
3248.66,3253.96, But the first reason they have told us is that we should keep this framework itself
3253.96,3258.34," because citizen's trust is important and we should be careful about treating individual rights,"
3258.56,3263.56," which is critically rebutted by Takotsu-san saying society now is becoming a hatred,"
3263.72,3265.88, having a hatred to a drinking culture
3265.88,3271.08, and this voice is not really heard under the jurisdiction system and we think that point
3271.08,3273.28," is dead, that point is dead, right?"
3273.36,3279.9," But secondly, more importantly, the query about the consequence of you being drunk is"
3279.9,3284.38," that you are not really fully informed about the consequence of that, right?"
3284.66,3285.74," Of drinking, right?"
3286.22,3292.0," So that's the point I pointed out in the introduction,"
3292.22,3295.56," where if the result is unexpected,"
3295.8,3299.24," then why the hell you can actually punish this individual at all, right?"
3299.24,3301.72," And we think when the point is you overgenerate,"
3301.92,3308.0, overly illustrate the effect of the drinking problem.
3308.0,3313.0, We think you lose the ground on why you can actually punish this individual.
3313.0,3321.0," But certainly more importantly, the point where you are forced by the boss and therefore"
3321.0,3326.38," you should be mitigated of this crime, right? Then we think it's not the point."
3326.74,3332.82," Anything that can influence you taking action should be a mitigating factor, right?"
3332.98,3339.58," Maybe you didn't choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early,"
3339.72,3343.48," and you didn't choose that, and you killed someone, and you should be mitigated, right?"
3343.48,3351.04, We think anything then should be a mitigating factor and we think explicitly we said drinking
3351.04,3356.88, and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously therefore
3356.88,3361.52," you should not be granted the mitigations, right?"
3361.52,3366.56, We think for that reason I'm very happy to propose.
