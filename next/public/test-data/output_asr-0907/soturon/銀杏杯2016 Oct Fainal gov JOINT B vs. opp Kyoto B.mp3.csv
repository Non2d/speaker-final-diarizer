0.0,14.0," Our goal is not only to protect the nation, but also to fight against the terrorism."
14.0,29.0," So, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here and speech. So I have three points today when the government wrote it"
29.0,30.0, as self-citizen.
30.0,32.0," But self-citizen, what does it mean?"
32.0,35.0, And who will we take and what for?
35.0,42.0," The second is that this land, so the payment paid for the"
42.0,50.0," terrorists, it means that the opposition side is suddenly against the other governmental role."
50.0,56.0, It's thought that this plan suddenly contributed to our governmental role.
56.0,60.0, So let me explain one by one.
60.0,63.0," Before that, I have to define this version."
63.0,66.0, This has to be of the whole government.
66.0,72.0," As the government told us, we clean the land that came in for ransom, so the terrorist bill."
72.0,76.0," So the terrorist bill is, please imagine, about the aliens and the terrorists."
76.0,78.0, So let me move on to my point.
78.0,81.0, First is the governmental role.
81.0,90.0," I think that, mainly in this debate, self-citizen is the consensus of the state, but self-citizen, what does it mean?"
90.0,94.0, It's completely different in these two sides.
94.0,130.0," So maybe they said that self-citizen means that they hope it, but this is individual. Our means of safe citizens is the safe mass the happiness life of the whole nation."
130.0,137.0," In order to achieve this goal, we have to set up an easy and peaceful society."
137.0,145.0," If the system of society collapses, we will never get a popular voice in Germany."
145.1,149.04," So in order to set up the healthy society,"
149.04,150.76, what we need is that system.
150.76,152.84," So mass system, not individual."
152.84,155.48," In this point, we put the clarity on the not individual,"
155.48,156.66, but the mass.
156.66,160.56," And so the society system means that,"
160.56,163.68," so only we go shopping to the town,"
163.68,164.84," or exciting the,"
168.0,172.0," exciting the day lives. So go home, sleep peacefully and go overseas like that."
172.0,175.0, We can enjoy all that is daily life.
175.0,191.0," It's that I think that ultimate happy in this world. So, how we write the second point is that the payment for the long term is certainly"
191.0,208.0, against this goal. Why? So A is that pay to the terrorist group is the trigger to pull on this kind of list.
208.0,212.0," Because once we pay to the terrorist, they will recognize us."
212.0,218.0," We sell the kids, kids need from this government, we can get the money."
218.0,224.0," Why? So, why does the terrorist group do kids need or get hostage?"
224.0,225.4, Means they are they want money.
225.4,229.4, So ISMS and so on is a very isolated organization.
229.4,233.1, So they have very struggling to deal with that money.
233.1,241.8," So in order to get money, they get hit, kid-snipping, get hostage and again and again and get money from them."
241.8,245.0," So if they recommend that our government,"
245.0,249.0," from our government, they can derive the money,"
249.0,253.0," so they do again and again, so that this kind of list"
253.0,256.0, of the big hostages will be suddenly increased.
256.0,260.0, The significance of being is that to get money
260.0,264.0, is that it means that the co-operate to get terrorist
264.0,266.0, is suddenly vicious because so this kind of terrorist is that it means that the cult operates to the terrorists here. It's certainly vicious.
266.0,270.0," So this kind of terrorism is certainly anti-social group,"
270.0,292.0," so that it tries to destroy our peaceful or healthy society. and also gave them money to buy weapons or pay for the air,"
292.0,298.0," and so on, so that it certainly be a power to the IS-IS."
298.0,302.0," So in two points, payment for the terrorists,"
302.0,307.0," it is certainly against our governmental goal, to save the system,"
307.0,317.0," to save the health of society. However, some point, so this plan can be solved, this program,"
317.0,318.0, okay?
318.0,326.0," Okay, so do you mean that you want to make those victims of ransom. So you can't make victims of kidnapping."
326.0,329.0," So you neglect those victims of kidnapping,"
329.0,332.0, rather than potential .
332.0,335.0," So one is that, so after I've explained to you"
335.0,338.0, that these kinds of the list of how this keeps
338.0,340.0," living in the sequence, the second"
340.0,344.0," is that we actually clean up the payment,"
344.0,346.76," but other kinds of ways. For example, co-operates."
346.76,350.26," So a few years ago, when our Japanese Japanese"
350.26,354.76," are hosted by the ISIs, we are co-operated"
354.76,357.84, by the Turkey government or a closed system
357.84,359.5, and try to save them.
359.5,362.62," And like this kind of the way, we already allow."
364.56,373.0," And sometimes if we cannot actually succeed in this kind of success,"
373.0,393.0," but if we don't, but London, we prioritize in that after taking this proposal, A, the list of the target hostages is suddenly replaced."
393.0,398.0," Because as I said, the incentive of the kids living on hostages is their money."
398.0,405.5," If they recognize that, even though we do keep kids living on the host hostage, we cannot get that money."
405.5,410.0, They stop their subscription in an inefficient way because they cannot get money.
410.0,428.0," And for subsidies, we can decrease the future number of victims of the host. The thing is that the decrease of IS-IS money, so that it doesn't only decrease"
428.0,434.0," the money by weapons or by the army, so it's the time for IS-IS to get richer and richer,"
434.0,442.0, we can destroy the society's threatened power itself. The problem is that we can achieve
442.0,445.0, the whole thing in one time. So thank you for listening.
449.0,451.0, Thank you Prime Minister.
452.0,484.9," Now welcome our Ronaldina, the opposition to to send us to the steps."
484.9,487.0, In order to save citizens from
487.0,491.0," mass attack, which it introduces as a plan. But ladies and gentlemen, that is a strange"
491.0,498.0," story, an indirect story. Why? Because we can prevent mass attack for citizens by terrorism"
498.0,507.0," by more direct plan. For example, air bombing or government restrictions directly to the terrorism."
507.0,517.0," For example, actually we're doing some scheme to the terrorists in ISIS by, for example,"
517.0,522.0," air bombing and actually killing radio users of ISIS, actually they are weakened by air"
522.0,526.0," bombing. So actually we do work by direct, multi-react"
526.0,533.0, plans. It cannot be the reason to criminalize payment for ransom to achieve the government's
533.0,540.0, goals. We think that the opposite side of that was that we should lose safety to those
540.0,547.0, who kidnap by paying ransom to terrorism and that is really important
547.94,554.94," as the government, as the parents. I'm going to explain in the first bit, thank you, about"
555.06,562.06, those who are kidnapped and secondly about freedom of choice of those who pay ransom.
562.06,567.46," Let's move to the third point which is about those who are kidnapped rations. Let's move into the first point, which is about losing the opportunity to save those who are kidnapped."
567.46,572.12, So I understand at school why a terrorist and a kidnapping
572.12,575.0, people wouldn't see in the general race
575.0,579.26, the kidnapped by ISIS or innocent children
579.26,581.76, are kidnapped by the terrorists.
581.76,584.98," So after that, in order to save them,"
584.98,589.0," the other people or parents, partners, sometimes"
589.0,597.0," the States themselves pay ransom to terrorists. And that is the only way to save their children,"
597.0,608.24," save the children of those who were kidnapped. For example, if they pay, of course, for example, we can find a case of Japanese journalists kidnapped by ISIS."
608.72,612.78," When the Japanese government denies paying ransom, they are killed, actually."
613.1,614.92," No, thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
616.24,621.82," But if they pay ransom, they certainly, actually, they can say..."
621.82,623.38," No, thank you."
623.54,634.38," They can say that those who are kidnapped, for example, in the Spanish government, or the European government, or the same journalists by paying ransom to ISIS, actually have the case."
634.38,647.0," So actually, it's reasonable to say that the kidnappers, if we pay ransom to them, those who are kidnapped are released and actually we can save them."
647.0,652.0, And of course...
652.0,653.0," No, thank you."
653.0,659.0," No, thank you. After taking his blood, what will happen? Those who, even though the"
659.0,664.0," those who pay ransom have no responsibility for the children, for the partners to be kidnapped,"
664.0,667.0, but they are criminalized to pay ransom.
667.0,669.0," And after that, what happens?"
669.0,671.0," They can't pay, of course they cannot pay ransom,"
671.0,674.0, or sometimes terrorism kills the people.
674.0,681.0," And of course, terrorism is no use demanding ransom to the people,"
681.0,684.0, ransom to the victims.
684.0,687.0," But they need money, so actually that's why they do ransom."
693.0,698.38," So what will happen? They start human trafficking, they start organ trading, by doing that, by"
698.38,708.02," any means, they want money, so they do inhuman things more over. No thank you. So actually, what will happen, even though we can say that"
708.02,712.04," by paying ransom, they are not, they won't be saved."
712.4,716.06," They will die by, killed by terrorism. The important"
716.06,719.88, thing is in this argument is that
719.88,724.26, paying ransom is a certain way to save
724.26,727.0," those who are kidnapped, I mean the innocent people."
727.0,732.0, And that is the importance in this first argument.
732.0,737.0, So why is the priority not only the mass but the individuals?
737.0,739.0," Right, right, ladies and gentlemen."
739.0,751.24," Of course we need to protect mass citizens from bombing, but I say that in order to save"
751.24,759.28," mass citizens from a terrorist attack, we have a more effective plan, for example air"
759.28,770.0," bombing, a more direct plan to do that, to really criminalize and pay ransom is too far from their purpose."
770.0,776.0, That is why we shouldn't criminalize payment of ransom.
776.0,778.0," Let's move on to the second point, which is freedom of choice."
778.0,784.0, Where freedom of choice is important. Let's look at two things.
784.0,785.44, The first thing is that the right weather is a rational choice or important. Let's look at two things. The first thing is that the right
785.44,790.92," weather is a rational choice or not. And second, it is harm to others. First, the"
790.92,797.56," rational choice. In the case of children, children are kidnapped by terrorism, for"
797.56,803.0," the parents, children is really important existence. So even if they pay ransom to"
803.0,807.0," terrorism, they want to, as the parents,"
807.0,813.0," they want to save the children, because the parents have a duty to protect their children."
813.0,818.0," And that is the rational choice to pay ransom to terrorism. And second, the case that the"
818.0,824.0," government started, because the government paid ransom to release those who were kidnapped"
824.0,827.0," by paying ransom, is that also we can say"
827.0,832.0," that it is a rational choice because as the government, it is the duty to protect citizens"
832.0,839.0, and save the citizens from a serious situation. So we can say also in this case that it is
839.0,845.0," a rational choice. Let's move on to the second point, which is harm to others."
845.0,849.0," Firstly, we don't know how to use the money."
849.0,860.0, It's uncertain how the terrorists use the money they get from the ransomware.
860.0,873.0," Moreover, they commit crimes, they commit human crimes, as I said, kidnapping, because they need money, because they lack money."
873.0,893.0," Or if they have enough money, they don't do that, but it's a risk, it's high risk to be arrested, it's an organization. So we can say that because they don't have much money,"
893.0,898.0," because they need money, they start inhumane crimes."
898.0,905.0, If we pay enough ransom to those terrorism groups
905.36,908.52," that totally, when we say totally,"
908.52,912.04," because the kidnappers, I mean, terrorism,"
912.04,916.56," lose the motivation to have a risk,"
916.56,919.48," so totally, we can say these cases,"
919.48,921.48," inhuman cases, will decrease,"
921.48,928.0, and that is why we hope this must end.
930.0,935.0, Thank you Leader of Opposition. The World Court on November is going to continue their case events in a minute.
935.0,987.0, Thank you.ありがとうございました Thank you very much.
987.0,991.0," Thank you, Mr. Harumuska, and the harmonies and gentlemen in this house."
991.0,999.0," The next position of SAI says that we must save the victims of kidnapping, but we want to..."
999.0,1005.0, We want... The idea is that kidnapping itself will disappear.
1005.0,1011.0," So in order to achieve this goal, we must take this motion."
1011.0,1017.0, Only the opposition-side paradigm will not erase the kidnapping itself.
1017.0,1029.0," So, firstly, let me introduce my previous speaker."
1037.0,1045.0," Firstly, he said that we can surely save the victims, the hostages, if we pay the money. But it's not suddenly, because, for example, the ISIS people kidnapping,"
1046.8,1049.54," when the kidnapping occurred,"
1049.54,1053.3," the movie was thought that if,"
1055.22,1059.08," sorry, even if we paid the money,"
1059.08,1063.46, the terrorists will not surely release the hostage
1063.46,1072.0, because they are malicious people and do not always save the pledge.
1072.0,1087.98," Secondly, he said that terrorist groups will try to earn money with other ways like organ transfer and so on, but who will sell the trans-organ?"
1088.28,1090.56," Even if someone sells the organs,"
1091.56,1096.56, the difference is that the money terrorists can earn
1097.18,1098.76, at the one time.
1099.76,1103.32, We think the target of terrorist kidnap
1103.32,1110.32," is mainly journalists, or they demand money to nations, because"
1110.32,1116.58," nations have much money, and terrorists can get much money from the nation the most. So"
1116.58,1130.0, the kidnapping and demanding the money to nations is a very unique way for terrorists to earn money easily.
1130.0,1133.0, So let me move on to my arguments.
1133.0,1137.0, There are two arguments.
1137.0,1147.0," Firstly, let me reinforce my partner's argument about after taking this plan's program."
1147.0,1155.0," And second, where we can justify this notion."
1155.0,1169.0," Under the status quo, kidnapping of host hostage will never disappear as my partner told you because kidnapping can get much money easily."
1169.0,1187.0," For example, bank robbery is very risky for terrorists because bank is very high secured and one person is not so secure. But after taking this motion, kidnapping will disappear or at least suddenly decrease because"
1187.0,1193.0, the nation will never give terrorists money and terrorists know that even if we kidnap
1193.0,1213.0," we can't get money. Also, journalists who go to those areas of terrorism, they will care more about the security. For example, they will hire bodyguards."
1213.0,1227.0, They will be more careful. Soment will kill more people. Money given to terrorists will be
1234.08,1249.0," used to achieve the terrorist's goal by violent led way. For example, as my partner told you, much money will allow the terrorist to buy weapons, many latest or strong weapons."
1249.0,1270.0," So, terrorists will kill drastically lots of people rather than just the kidnapping of one person. For example, in some times, quite a plane attacked the big building and over 1 million people died."
1270.0,1290.0," So if the terrorist group got the money, they will surely use this money to the crime because they are malicious people and they are willing to use violent way or crime to achieve their goal."
1290.0,1296.0," So, terrorists surely kill people."
1296.0,1302.0, Paying money to terrorists means cooperating terrorism.
1302.0,1306.88," Government cannot cooperate terrorism,"
1306.88,1309.72, that means crimes and killing people.
1309.72,1314.68," They said that government needs direct way to send people,"
1314.68,1318.88, but we see indirect murder is also murder.
1318.88,1321.86, Government must not indirectly kill people.
1321.86,1323.32, So in here.
1323.32,1326.28," Okay, so let me move on to, also,"
1326.28,1330.28, she did not explain about other complete way
1330.28,1334.06," to save mass people, so please give me"
1334.06,1337.84, the complete way to save mass people.
1337.84,1340.08," Okay, so let me move on to the second argument."
1340.08,1341.82, What we can justify?
1341.82,1347.0," For example, in case of disaster, many people are injured."
1347.0,1367.44," We, or doctors, prioritize people who Because they cannot save all people,"
1368.38,1371.52, they must prioritize the number of people.
1371.52,1374.36," Because the more people we save,"
1374.36,1376.24, the more people will be happy.
1376.24,1380.28," So it is completely, it is same to this notion."
1382.38,1393.0," Yes, we think that sometimes, even if the case starts, some individual hostages will die."
1393.0,1409.0," But let's compare the number of people's lives, one individual or mass of 1,000 or 1 million people, of course we must"
1409.0,1417.0, prioritize the mass of people. So therefore we can justify and we strongly propose this model.
1417.0,1419.0, Thank you for listening.
1422.0,1430.0," Thank you, members of the government. We will now go to a member who will continue to continue their case within seven minutes."
1430.0,1467.0, Here she is. Gå in på en kål. Their goal was to save the potentially killed Maksitians.
1467.0,1479.0, And their policy is to travel by plane and to the Maksitians.
1479.0,1485.3," Okay, if you want to save the potentially killed Maksit citizens, then why not kill the terrorist groups themselves"
1485.3,1488.9, and even destroy the organization itself?
1488.9,1492.48," If we can, directly air bomb or directly attack"
1492.48,1495.4," or stop economic restriction,"
1495.4,1499.66," then we can actually, we can comparatively"
1499.66,1501.32, decrease the power of terrorist groups.
1501.32,1503.6," Then if those kind of power would be decreased,"
1503.6,1507.44," then those terrorist groups cannot kill those potentially killing mass citizens,"
1507.44,1509.12, then their goal is achieved.
1509.12,1512.84, We believe that their policy is not unique in this role.
1512.84,1514.04, That's why you believe it.
1514.04,1515.68, That's why you oppose this motion.
1515.68,1517.38," So before going through arguments,"
1517.38,1518.7, let me rebuttal first.
1518.7,1522.38," So before we go through rebuttals,"
1522.38,1524.78, I would like to analyze actors in this debate.
1524.78,1527.46, There are two main actors we have to protect.
1527.46,1530.76, First is the individual citizens who are being kidnapped.
1530.76,1533.68," And second, those potentially mass citizens."
1533.68,1536.5," OK, let's go from the first actor."
1536.5,1539.04," In their paradigm, in the United States,"
1539.04,1544.44, if the individual citizens were kidnapped by the terrorist
1544.44,1545.9," group,"
1545.9,1549.02, we have only one way to save those citizens.
1549.02,1550.1, That is to ransom.
1550.1,1554.72, And they told us that if we can actually
1554.72,1557.3," cooperate with the government, they can take it."
1557.3,1558.96," First of all, is that there is no case"
1558.96,1560.1, that having a chief is.
1560.1,1562.3," They said that Turkey and Japan actually cooperated,"
1562.3,1565.5," but in fact, those hostages were killed."
1565.5,1568.5, So we believe that kind of government cooperation is meaningless.
1568.5,1572.5, Why is that meaningless? This is our second reason why we have revolted.
1572.5,1577.0, Why is that impossible? Because the terrorist groups need money.
1577.0,1583.0," If they need money, they have to exclude the government from the hostages."
1583.0,1587.56," They will desperately kill those same sort of hostages from the government from the hostages, they will desperately kill those same hostages"
1587.56,1588.26, from the government.
1588.26,1590.18," And they have those incentives to have it,"
1590.18,1591.2, because they need money.
1591.2,1593.72," So that's why you believe that even if a government cooperates,"
1593.72,1600.26, it's impossible to save citizens just by other means
1600.26,1600.9, that are around them.
1600.9,1602.68, So you believe that ransom is the only way
1602.68,1604.32, to save those kidnapped citizens.
1604.32,1606.06," Then, if we rely on those citizens,"
1606.06,1609.06, then those citizens will surely be killed.
1609.06,1611.22, So we believe that those individual citizens is
1611.22,1611.8, important.
1611.8,1613.76, And why is this individual citizen important?
1613.76,1616.92, Because it is inherent and certainly be killed
1616.92,1618.14, if we don't pay maximum.
1618.14,1619.98, Because the second factor is talking
1619.98,1621.6, about a potentially killed mass citizen.
1621.6,1623.94, We cannot understand the potentially killed mass
1623.94,1624.44, citizen.
1624.44,1626.6," And in fact, the logic a lot of thoughts being clear."
1626.6,1628.3, We believe that this is not inherent.
1628.3,1631.2," But in fact, those individual kidnaps are inherent."
1631.2,1635.2, Those people are surely being killed when we .
1635.2,1636.8, That's why we believe that it's important.
1636.8,1640.5," So after taking this plan, we get ."
1640.5,1645.42," And we believe that after taking their policy, will happen."
1645.42,1648.46," They say that the case of kidnapping will decrease,"
1648.46,1649.7, but we think that is not true.
1649.7,1650.3, Why is that?
1650.3,1655.06, Because kidnapping is a rather easier way to save money.
1655.06,1657.24," If we kidnap those people, then we"
1657.24,1662.34," can use those people from sending those people themselves,"
1662.34,1663.88, or use the order of trade.
1663.88,1667.6, And there are other ways of taking money other than ransom.
1667.6,1671.38, So that's why I believe that even though we criminalize
1671.38,1674.84," the ransom, those citizens will still be kidnapped."
1674.84,1677.22," So that's why I believe that even if you take this motion,"
1677.22,1679.62, those individually kidnapped citizens
1679.62,1681.8, will not be rescued.
1681.8,1685.0," So if we do not have to, then there's a way, ransom."
1685.0,1688.0," And if we can pay ransom, we can actually help those citizens."
1688.0,1690.0," That's why I believe to help individual citizens,"
1690.0,1692.0, we should not take this motion.
1692.0,1695.0," Let's talk about the second actor, the potentially killed mass citizens."
1695.0,1700.0," Their logic was that if terrorists can gain money,"
1700.0,1704.0," they will buy weapons, and then they will kill mass citizens."
1704.0,1707.0," There are two logics, and I would like your bottom to do this too. First logic was that if they gain money, they will buy weapons and then they will give them master weapons. Okay, there are two logics. I would like to go over those two."
1707.0,1710.0," First logic was that if they gave money, they would buy weapons."
1710.0,1715.0," Okay, the terrorist group's purpose is that they have to kill people."
1715.0,1720.0," So even though the terrorist group does not have money, they have to have an air bomb and they have to kill."
1720.0,1727.32, So they have to... their attack is on the expense of the group member itself.
1727.32,1730.06," So if they get money, what we know they do"
1730.06,1733.76, is that they will actually use the money for themselves.
1733.76,1736.5," For example, under the current situation, people in ISIS are poor."
1736.5,1740.5," So what they do is that they do a raid, or they rob something"
1740.5,1741.76, because they don't have money.
1741.76,1744.72," But if they get money, then they can use that money for a living."
1744.72,1745.0," And those inhumane crimes will actually be free. because they don't have money. But if they get money, then they can use that money for a living,"
1745.0,1748.0, and those humane crimes will actually decrease.
1748.0,1753.0," In that case, those victims of that crime will actually decrease,"
1753.0,1757.0, and those kinds of zero-life manufacturers will be safe in that potential.
1757.0,1762.0," Second, we believe that in the first place, if we stop ransom,"
1762.0,1765.0, those terrorists will not stop killing people.
1765.0,1766.0, Why is that?
1766.0,1767.0, Because their purpose is not...
1767.0,1773.0," Their purpose, first, is that they have other ways to gain money, and second, is that their"
1773.0,1776.0," purpose is to attack people, so they will not stop them."
1776.0,1781.0," So if we cannot destroy the terrorist group itself, those people will not be safe at all."
1781.0,1786.68," So we believe that potentially, those messages will be killed on their part in this first group."
1786.68,1788.72," OK, what happens after taking this plan?"
1788.72,1790.52," Because we're actually in that group,"
1790.52,1792.74," we destroy the terrorist group itself,"
1792.74,1794.06," and destroy the group themselves,"
1794.06,1797.38, we believe that if we directly attack and decrease
1797.38,1799.0," the power of terrorist groups, then we"
1799.0,1802.68, don't have enough power to attack the people as a backlash.
1802.68,1805.6, So we believe that those kind of potentially killed
1805.6,1808.28, mass citizens would be treated in our paradigm
1808.28,1809.34, rather than their paradigm.
1809.34,1811.26, So that's why we believe that the criminal offence
1811.26,1813.72, of ransom is not relative to this motion.
1813.72,1814.54," No, thank you."
1814.54,1816.38, So how about our argument itself?
1816.38,1821.18, Because we believe that in the first individual citizen
1821.18,1823.94," character, we can protect them by paying ransom."
1823.94,1826.0, And it is clear WP ransom.
1826.0,1828.0, They will lose individual citizens.
1828.0,1830.0, We go back to our case.
1832.0,1834.0, Top.
1834.0,1836.0, Last connection analysis of two actors.
1836.0,1838.0," So,"
1838.0,1840.0, I would like to compare which of you won.
1840.0,1842.0," Okay, so, as I told you,"
1842.0,1844.0, individual kid in that student
1844.0,1845.0, are inherent.
1845.0,1849.0," And if we don't pay ransom, they will be killed."
1849.0,1850.0, Sure.
1850.0,1858.0," Or, on the other hand, potentially killed by a man-centered death, we cannot expect how many people would be killed in the first place."
1858.0,1863.0," And furthermore, we cannot even understand whether those students would be killed."
1863.0,1867.44," So, I think, we don't think that amount is important."
1867.44,1871.62," We believe that if someone would be surely killed,"
1871.62,1874.4," and we think that a potentially killed,"
1874.4,1875.92," not a potentially killed citizen,"
1875.92,1878.84, but rather an inherent individual kidnapped
1878.84,1881.68," citizen, saving those people is more important"
1881.68,1883.76, than potentially killed citizens.
1883.76,1887.2, That's why we believe that the believe that we have to save the individual
1887.2,1890.48," citizens inherently, and because we think that those"
1890.48,1893.84," kill, we can randomly get sure that we save those people."
1893.84,1895.44, We're happy to propose this motion.
1903.44,1905.88," Thank you, Mayor, for your questions."
1910.44,1910.78, So the vote for the virtual reply is going to be in four minutes.
1975.0,1978.0," Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the important marker in this debate is to save citizens, and both sides agree, both sides' purpose was that."
1978.0,1989.34," So let's compare the government's side view of this as be at first. And secondly, in which case can citizens"
1989.34,1993.98, save the citizens more and more and less and less?
1993.98,1996.68," So firstly, let's look at the Gaffin case."
1996.68,2000.4, The Gaffin case was that they should
2000.4,2003.88, try to take this motion in order to protect mass citizens
2003.88,2004.72, from terrorism.
2004.72,2005.0, The citizens were citizens from terrorism.
2005.0,2008.0, The citizens do it. They mention that terrorism demands money for kidnapping.
2008.0,2014.0," So for example, they kidnap the terrorists and they demand money for nations."
2014.0,2020.0," And they get mass money, much money, by kidnapping."
2020.0,2027.0," And if you pay, we call for terrorism, it should be justified, and terrorism are strong offends,"
2027.0,2032.0," and that is a problem, and potentially citizens will be included in the status quo."
2032.0,2036.0," The African-Islam, they have the money we pay, so they decrease the number of ransoms,"
2036.0,2039.0," and of course the terrorism will weaken, and that's the citizen we will save."
2039.0,2046.48," So that's a view of the government side and Office of Science and Social, saying that, of course,"
2046.48,2049.02, we can save the mass citizens under the status quo
2049.02,2053.56," now by directly attacking air bombing, terrorism."
2053.56,2060.08, And that is the more effective and more direct plan.
2060.08,2062.24, And so that is really a super-rate
2062.24,2065.0, to the indirect plan and far-flung.
2065.0,2072.0," And secondly, with Consistory saying that we don't neglect each citizen, we save the citizen."
2072.0,2092.0," And it's also important to look at each one's citizens and save them by paying ransom for the citizens, so that of course we surely cannot save each individual citizen for terrorism"
2092.0,2107.24," and also saying that the number of ransoms don't decrease, unfortunately moreover when we look at one decrease and one decrease,"
2107.24,2108.28, that is a problem.
2108.28,2111.1," So of course, that is a problem."
2111.1,2113.44, That's our view of this debate today.
2113.44,2117.44," So let's look at the citizens, in which case"
2117.44,2120.76, the citizens are more safe.
2120.76,2127.0," And the government said, on the government side's view, after taking his land, unfortunately,"
2130.0,2137.0, the number of ransom will increase. Why? Because they mentioned that they kidnap and
2140.0,2145.94," demand money for nations and get much money. So when they kidnapped us, after taking this plan,"
2145.94,2147.62," the nations, of course, don't pay money,"
2147.62,2149.28, ransom to the terrorists.
2149.28,2150.54, So what happened?
2150.54,2152.12," They did, of course, they need money,"
2152.12,2153.96," so that is the motivation for terrorism,"
2153.96,2157.48," that they throw organ transplants for profit or organ,"
2158.48,2159.98," okay, mine."
2159.98,2164.2," Of course, we can get money, but the money they get"
2164.2,2168.0," from organ transportation for profit is less than they get from Asians,"
2168.0,2175.0, or they need to kidnap more and more people by getting certain money.
2175.0,2187.0," So the case of ransom will surely increase after taking this motion, and of course the mass"
2189.44,2195.44," citizens will be decreased. It is uncertain in the story, and far less direct plans and"
2195.44,2202.44," more uncertain plans. And compared to government side's view, the opposition side's view was"
2202.62,2229.0," that we surely save the citizens who are kidnapped individuals, we can save them, and of course we can protect and potentially kill more citizens from directly bombing, directly killing the terrorists, which is more effective and more direct, and because of these reasons we can save more citizens by not taking this solution."
2229.0,2231.0, And that's why we oppose. Thank you.
2235.0,2237.0, Thank you. We can applaud.
2237.0,2241.0, So the law court of Nagavame is reached last night to debate in four minutes.
2241.0,2289.0," Thank you. So in this slide, I have learned need to explain how important to save nation becomes its consensus."
2289.0,2299.0, So its consensus is that saving the nation. So how we achieve this goal is the same as the consensus.
2299.0,2306.94," So let me summarize this about this problem. Okay, so the point is that,"
2306.94,2310.2," one, the sacrifice to the payment,"
2310.2,2312.6," so the land will come back again,"
2312.6,2314.34," and come back again,"
2314.34,2315.6," and secondly is that,"
2315.6,2318.16," and so that, due to that payment,"
2318.16,2321.16," the citizens, the neighbors are sacrificing themselves."
2321.16,2322.06," And third is that,"
2322.06,2326.8, so if the IS-IS do not fall in a poor they stop
2327.92,2334.56, snacking because they have no need to do it however it's all dead it's all not true
2339.28,2352.0," so once the one dog is that it's really there uh after our meat was taken, it doesn't make the next case negative."
2352.0,2356.0," At present, they are falling in a fall."
2356.0,2368.0," If they didn't get the money, they just not like they are mentally attacking."
2368.0,2374.0," So as long as they have money, so they use it all,"
2374.0,2378.0," so that they need more and they need money,"
2378.0,2405.9," so they need money always. Love is that, it's my point, it's just that co-operate to the entire group so that actually we can save the individual citizens at that time, but behind that top date we expect 100,000 testis. The second point is that payment,"
2407.9,2409.46," that payment they need are sacrificing,"
2409.46,2412.4," but I cannot say, I cannot see that a real example"
2412.4,2414.6," if really they are sacrificing themselves,"
2414.6,2418.2, so I think it's a valid argument.
2418.2,2420.12, So it's meaningless.
2420.12,2422.9," The last is that if they are not foreign poor,"
2422.9,2427.0," they do not keep snapping, or they are just eager to religious, they just go for poor, they do not keep snapping or they are just eager to religious,"
2427.0,2432.0, they just go so that they do not stop terrorism attacks. So these are all misunderstandings.
2432.0,2437.0," So why? Because at the same time they need money, they want all this."
2437.0,2450.12," And secondly, if they are achieving, they want, they are just eager, religious globe, however it's not true. For example, the IS-IS is not the one domestic religious globe,"
2450.12,2459.68," but it hires many kinds of other nations,"
2459.68,2468.28, other nations from the French and the O.
2468.28,2472.36," So the payments, so they need the pay, so a lot of payments,"
2472.36,2473.64, so all is needed.
2473.64,2474.98, So they are falling apart.
2474.98,2479.76," And however, on the contrary, our cases,"
2479.76,2483.02, so the most inconstant thing is that we can certainly
2483.02,2485.8," make that terrorism itself. It certainly be a root, we can certainly make that tell us itself."
2485.8,2487.54, It certainly will be a root.
2487.54,2490.82, We can solve the root cause of the old one.
2490.82,2495.82, And they are just giving us the solution of the time
2500.36,2501.2, and of the time.
2501.2,2504.36, We want to solve this motion from the root cause.
2504.36,2510.0, So we can see no more expected holidays because we stop to paint there.
2510.0,2514.0, And second is that we do not cooperate with them worldwide.
2514.0,2518.0, We define as this house means that worldwide.
2518.0,2523.0, So worldwide we stop to paint there.
2523.0,2525.08, So they suddenly fall in poor.
2527.66,2532.66," And they have no money to do the telethon,"
2533.18,2535.62, so the telethon group suddenly collapsed.
2535.62,2537.44," So this is the fundamental goal,"
2537.44,2542.18, and it's the only one way to achieve the ideal world.
2542.18,2543.76, So thank you.
2547.24,2549.16, Thank you for your time also.
