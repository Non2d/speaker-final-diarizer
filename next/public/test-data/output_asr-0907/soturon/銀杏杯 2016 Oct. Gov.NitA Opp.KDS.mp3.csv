0.0,3.0, ...of the Kuchong Park in 2016.
3.0,8.0, A motion for this one is to stop the criminalize the payment of ransom to terrorist groups
8.0,14.0, without force of the United States to call upon the Prime Minister to deliver the affirmative case.
14.0,45.0, We will see you here in a minute. Thank you. I'm going to show you the inside of the room.
45.0,50.0, This is the bathroom.
50.0,55.0, This is the bathroom.
55.0,60.0, This is the bathroom.
60.0,91.68," This is the bathroom. Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen in this house, our side believes that we want to protect most moral people, every people, so every innocent people."
92.08,100.18, And now another thing that's called the technology of hacking system or security camera is developing now.
100.64,107.7, And police can't supply the information in the group of terrorists.
107.7,115.46," So, those things, we can assert those terrorists move and act."
115.88,121.7, And the payment of ransom is money source of terrorists and criminal groups.
122.06,124.16, Huge rate of money source is ransom.
124.72,127.0," Plus, criminal is"
127.0,136.0," very malicious. So, in many cases, even if victim's side pays huge money to the terrorist"
136.0,152.0," group and criminal groups, the victim will be killed by them. This is very major case, but the family wants to protect their own family or own child, so they give money."
152.0,156.0," Okay, let's move on my argument. I have two arguments in this round."
156.0,168.28," Firstly, I'd like to talk about long-term benefits, cut the terrorist's source of money. And secondly, to save all people and the victims,"
169.34,172.4, this plan is very efficient way.
173.0,175.84," Before, I want to define this motion."
175.84,178.84," This house means all liberal democratic countries,"
179.78,193.54," and when criminals request ransom to individual victims of family or government or bank, in all situations, be criminalized the payment of ransom."
193.54,195.54," Okay, let's move on to argument."
195.54,211.0," Firstly, I'd like to talk about the long-term benefits. Under the status quo, families strongly love their children or they have very great memories from their children."
211.0,214.0," So they strongly want to save, right?"
214.0,221.0, So suddenly they give the money to terrorist groups.
221.0,225.0," They are very confused about, it's crazy situation."
225.0,230.0, So they easily without concern with police or specialist.
230.0,236.0, So they cannot judge this system objectively.
236.0,249.0," So in the major case, they are very rich, so they can give the money. Another way is they are poor, they rent from the black"
249.0,256.0," market or something, not so good source of the money, come to the family house and this"
256.0,265.2, money is go to the terrorist groups. So terrorists get huge source of money. Why is it so big home?
265.62,269.36," Because if the terrorists have huge money,"
269.78,271.96," they can buy more weapons,"
271.96,279.82," such as gun and more harmful drugs or something,"
280.14,284.18," gas, so they can expand power easily"
284.18,286.38, if they have more money
287.8,295.08, What's the accident be a person due to the money so people to stop this are this source
297.76,301.62, We create a payment of ransom so
333.0,351.0," Many people don't want criminal rights. So they can case, police can effectively search the situation because they have the technology, as I mentioned in our introduction, hacking or searching"
351.0,393.0," past the security camera, we can arrest terrorists and save more, not expand the harm for another people and worse case. I'd like to explain why this plan has effectively saved more people than now."
393.0,413.0," As I mentioned in the introduction, even if paying all ransom to terrorist groups, this money, even if the terrorist is very malicious, they kill or"
413.0,425.0, more money they request. So this request is not cut by only one request of ransom.
428.0,433.0," So this is not the safe, not the conserved."
439.0,444.0, Then this ransom cannot save the victor surely.
444.54,445.0," And also, as I mentioned again and again, but Lamson cannot save the victim, surely."
445.0,453.0," And also, as I mentioned again and again, this money is very harmful to society"
453.0,465.0," because of the accident that occurred, and also the individual family and victims cannot save thanks to Lamson."
465.64,470.64, So we strongly believe that Lamson is not meaningless
472.3,475.3," for the saving the individual victim,"
478.18,481.18, and also it is very harmful for the society.
482.78,487.0," In this viewpoint, we strongly propose this motion,"
487.0,489.0, and I'm happy to propose.
489.0,531.0," Thank you for listening. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, what the government says is that the reason why we have to prosecute"
531.0,537.0," the terrorists is that because they kill the citizens, they murder the citizens."
537.0,542.0," Ladies and gentlemen, we think that because in order to not to consider terrorists, they"
542.0,550.0," are going to sacrifice their existence. We believe that it is not very counterproductive, counter... against the fundamental purpose"
550.0,553.0," was against terrorism, the real opposite of what was out there."
553.0,560.0," So, before moving on my argumentation, I have to talk about something to talk about, something about this argument."
560.0,569.0," Firstly, we have to consider, we have to confirm that the resource of the terrorists does not necessarily come from the ransom itself, ladies and gentlemen."
569.0,585.0," For example, the income of the ISIS comes from the oil fields they took, or the donations from the assistance of these kind of terrorist groups."
585.0,589.0," We think that in those cases, it is very unclear from the government's"
589.0,595.0, argumentation how to much extent the existence of ransom is going to
595.0,600.0," contribute to the genocide of the terrorist group. However, we think that"
600.0,610.0," in those cases, in this debate, we think that because the land sign is safe, it does not contribute to the empowerment of the terrorists."
610.0,615.0, We don't think it's the reason or the purpose.
615.0,621.0," About the model of the government, the government has said that they are going to let the police to censor students."
621.0,625.0, We think it is not idealistic.
625.0,630.0," Under their model, we are going to let the police to"
630.0,635.0," like therapy, but we think it is not something justifiable, even if it"
635.0,640.0, can contribute to the
640.0,651.0, management of terrorism. And also we think that because even if the government does take the wrong decision not
651.0,657.0," to go to the terrorist group, we think that as long as the government can fulfill their"
657.0,663.0," duty to protect the citizens, the government should not respect individuals to save the"
663.0,665.0, others or save the citizens. the government should not respect individuals to safety as for safety.
665.0,670.0," So moving on to the guardian, to the opposition side."
670.0,673.0," About the model of the opposition side, we have to go back to the core."
673.0,678.0," First, we are going to take the countermeasure against the terrorists."
678.0,689.0," That is to say, after helping the hostages, we are going to do the airstrike and so on. And secondly, as I say, income of terrorists comes from not only the ransom, but rather"
689.0,695.0," comes from the other resources such as the oil fields, such as the case of ISIS and so"
695.0,696.0, on.
696.0,700.0," And three, that we don't necessarily pay the ransom in the accord."
700.0,704.0, The reality is that we are going to give the choice for citizens whether or not they are
704.0,705.0, going to pay the ransom or not.
705.0,713.0, We require citizens to compare the risk that they are going to be beneficial for themselves to save the hostage and so on.
713.0,719.0," And also, of course, in the paradigm, we are going to require every state to intervene in the negotiation of terrorists"
719.0,728.0," in order to moderate the amount of money, the amount of ransom that the citizens are going to pay for the saves and hostage funds."
728.0,738.0," So fundamentally we think that because there are some factors, the inevitable kidnappers are one of those."
738.0,739.0, This is my first argument.
739.0,749.0," We think that fundamentally in the case of the spy or the soldier that the government sent to the terrorist group, we think that they are not responsible for their own fault."
749.0,770.0," That is to say, they did nothing. We government is fully responsible for saving these kind of people."
770.0,779.0," Because we think that the government let them go to the very dangerous area, and as a consequence, they are going to face the devastating problem."
779.0,785.0," We think that in that case, the government shouldn't deny the claimant ransom."
785.0,792.0," And also, we think that the ransom is the most effective way to save these kind of hostages."
792.0,797.0," Because we think that if the terrorist does not release these kind of hostages,"
797.0,806.0," that means that the terrorist is going to express in public that if we are going to get the ransom, we are not released,"
806.0,810.0, that we are not returned as hostages.
810.0,817.0, The right is to say that the terrorist group is going to incentivize the public to pay ransom.
817.0,822.0," So in that case, the case is a competitive countervote for the terrorist group."
822.0,825.08," Therefore, we think that if David pays a ransom,"
825.08,826.64, terrorist groups have an incentive
826.64,828.74, to return these kind of hostage.
828.74,831.7," And also, even if David stops the payment of the ransom,"
831.7,834.74, the kidnapping does not stop.
834.74,837.5, Because we think that the purpose of kidnapping
837.5,842.5," is not necessarily come from the income of the ransom,"
842.5,843.44, ladies and gentlemen.
843.44,846.0," For example, ISIS kidnapped the citizens in"
846.0,852.0," order to, for their local government, in order to clear the public to their sense, and also"
852.0,858.0," it can be beneficial for their self. And also in that case, the purpose of kidnapping"
858.0,863.0," necessarily comes from the ransom itself. Therefore, we think that because sometimes"
863.0,866.0, government is fully responsible for the
866.0,871.0," payment of ransom, and also there is an inevitable case of kidnapping, and also that even if"
871.0,879.0," after they can do the oposal, we cannot prevent the kidnapping to be trusted or the oposal."
879.0,885.0," And also in addition to that, we have to recognize that even if people fully take care of us,"
885.0,890.0," fully pay attention, they sometimes will be called by terrorists."
890.0,896.0," For example, even if you are outside of the terrorist territory, in the state of court,"
896.0,900.0," for example, the member of ISIS is going to call you beyond the border of the country,"
900.0,904.0," and those are the consequences, even if you pay full attention to that,"
904.0,905.74, you are going to be harassed by the terrorists.
906.0,910.3," But this is to say, we need to ensure that each citizen is protected themselves."
910.62,914.9," And also, why we need to ensure the right to help others."
915.2,920.96, We think that the reason why we allow the citizens as a self-defense to kill other people
920.96,928.54," is that because the government does not have the full capacity and duty to protect the citizens, citizens do not have any way to protect themselves"
928.54,933.24," by the state. The reason is that in this case, it can be applicable because we think that"
933.24,938.24, government failed to stop the citizens from going to these kinds of dangerous areas or
938.24,944.24," from being captured by terrorists. The reason is that in that case, it's because"
944.24,946.12," citizens have no way to protect themselves,"
946.12,948.1, and also government cannot fulfill
948.1,950.08," the fundamental rights of their duty,"
950.08,952.28," in that case, obviously government should ensure"
952.28,955.06, citizens themselves to protect themselves.
955.06,956.68," And also, in addition to that,"
956.68,958.9, the biggest problem with this government is that
958.9,962.44, why they can justify to criminalize the act
962.44,963.98," to save these kind of citizens,"
963.98,966.8, because we think that it's not completely comfortable
966.8,970.4, it's completely against the government the purpose of against the government
970.4,972.4, we are going to support it
976.4,980.0, okay for your comments are not solved by the member of government
980.0,1006.0," you can pass and extend my case, but that's out of my way. Take care. 1 tbs of butter 1 tbs of flour 1 tbs of butter"

1022.0,1024.0, 1 tbs of flour
1024.0,1128.0," 1 tbs of flour 1 tbs of flour The I'm going to make a The Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello ladies and gentlemen. Under the status quo, there are many incidents"
1128.0,1147.0," that by terrorists, many victims are existing,"
1147.0,1153.0," and the victims' families suffer from the lacking of family,"
1153.0,1159.0," and they are killed by the terrorists,"
1159.0,1167.0," the terrorist, so we have to stop the situation."
1167.0,1191.0," After taking a bath, there is no solution to stop the innocent citizen, but we can't stop the terrorists from killing people."
1191.0,1211.0," But after taking this plan, we can minimize the situation because the almost payment of the terrorist is ransom now and many money contribute to the terrorist by the citizens or government."
1211.0,1228.0," Also something, the individual issue, this is selfish and this make the more serious situation around the world. So we have to propose this proposal."
1228.0,1232.0," I, um, sorry."
1232.0,1236.0," Firstly, I will refute my previous speaker."
1236.0,1240.0, The previous speaker told you that the ransom payment
1240.0,1244.0, of ransom is small and
1244.0,1253.2," it's not, it does not affect the revenue of the terrorists and does not occur"
1253.2,1268.4," the terrible situation in terrorists, but it is not true. Because the one person charged by the terrorist, the government or something"
1268.4,1278.32," who want to save that person have to pay billion yen or ten billion yen or so, some very expensive"
1278.32,1290.5," way, expensive money. So that's why, please imagine the tank or rocket is about a billion yen or 10 million yen or so on."
1290.5,1298.96," So that's why by one person, only one person, the terrorists can buy many weapons."
1299.22,1305.0," And by only that weapon, many people are threatened by the station."
1305.0,1312.0, There is possibility to be killed by the rocket or tank or so.
1312.0,1330.6," Very serious, very harmful weapon. If around the world, the many victims are in the city, and many people pay much money to the terrorists,"
1330.6,1348.32," terrorist groups, as my partner told you that the terrorists can get much money and can have possibility to expand their power and after that around the world there are many incidents by terrorists"
1348.32,1387.0," and many people will suffer from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for Let me move on our argument. I will explain. By payment of ransom, the terrorist will abuse that are right to get some money, much money, and the harmful of the station."
1387.0,1389.0, One argument.
1389.0,1394.0," And secondly, I will compare them to the both sides."
1394.0,1399.0," Firstly, I will explain the opinion of ransomware is how harmful."
1399.0,1406.0," So do you think that a phone which killed thousands of people, you could have 2 billion yen?"
1413.0,1424.0," If the terrorists are followed by the government or police,"
1424.0,1427.0, it is harmful for terrorists itself.
1427.0,1441.0," So, the payment of ransom should be expensive because also terrorists have risk to be watched by the government"
1441.0,1449.0, or cast by the government because of the interaction with the terrorist and government.
1449.0,1455.0," So terrorists have risk, so terrorists can need much money."
1455.0,1471.0," So in order to save the victim, the citizens have to pay much money, something billion yen. Firstly I will explain the status quo's payment of ransom."
1477.0,1506.5," Payment of ransom is very expensive, so that's why the terrorists, as I told you in my reputation, there are many weapons in for terrorists, and terrorists have much money."
1506.5,1514.94," And even if the people can only save that victim, important for me, the many people"
1514.94,1531.0," around the world will be, other countries, other innocent citizens will be suffer from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for other people, many students."
1531.0,1535.0, So that's why we have to save many people.
1535.0,1539.0," And so, secondly, I will compare the both sides."
1539.0,1550.98," After taking this plan, in the opposition paradigm, there are many incidents now, and many people were killed by the terrorists."
1551.32,1566.0, So we have to save that person by taking this proposal. Thank you for your comment. Now I will call for the member of the opposition to present and all the right of peace.
1566.0,1640.4," The second is to hear from the chair. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that today the government's side has not pointed out"
1640.4,1645.0, any justification in which why we can actually criminalise these people who
1645.0,1650.0," actually want to just solely want to save their families, their loved ones' lives."
1650.0,1657.0, So I'd like to point out why under the criminal justice system this is not justifiable in
1657.0,1663.0, my speech later on. So we are proud to oppose. So basically in my speech I'd like to do three
1663.0,1667.14," things. Firstly, I'd like to talk about why I'm the recommender of the justice system,"
1667.44,1670.72," why this is not justifiable, so we have got the criteria here."
1671.02,1674.42," And secondly, I'd like to talk about how in the practical terms"
1674.42,1677.0, this plan is actually going to be counterproductive
1677.0,1681.76, and this will actually kill many more innocent people under their paradigm.
1682.1,1685.08," And thirdly, I'd like to talk about how it is"
1685.08,1690.26, the state's responsibility and it is only one form of self-defense in this term. So
1690.26,1696.22," yes, but before that, a couple of rebuttals to their points. So firstly, about the point"
1696.22,1703.58, about how we are going to censor security cameras and hacking systems to these families
1703.58,1705.86," or something. Well, we are very..."
1705.86,1708.34," So we do not understand this wealth ability at all, right?"
1708.38,1711.18, How are these people going to be saved after doing this?
1711.18,1719.62, And why is this going to be justified to continue censoring these innocent people?
1719.82,1722.66," And secondly, they talked about the long-term benefit,"
1722.92,1726.94, how we can stop the source and it will somehow lead to saving people.
1727.24,1732.16," But they have not given any mechanism to this point, right?"
1732.24,1736.86," So how will the stopping of payment of ransom actually save people, which I will talk about later on,"
1736.9,1748.24," because the source is not only ransom, and there are many other criteria and factors that actually is empowering these terrorist groups. And"
1748.24,1754.86, we believe that actually this causes detrimental harm because when we stop these families from
1754.86,1759.06," being able to pay this ransom, what will actually happen is that these families will not forget"
1759.06,1765.02," this fact that if they pay this ransom they are going to be criminalised,"
1769.02,1773.96, they will feel like they will be betrayed by the state. So it's actually rather just empowering the terrorists if they see that the state is conflicting within themselves.
1774.28,1781.56," So this actually causes much more harm. And also, there is other ways. We can at first"
1781.56,1789.78," pay and save this one individual that will definitely be taken away under their paradigm,"
1790.08,1795.48," and later on we can combat the terrorist in other ways, which is much more going to be important,"
1795.92,1797.2, and collect the money afterwards.
1797.5,1801.28, So we should leave this choice to be able to pay this ransom.
1801.46,1802.96, So I will talk about that later on.
1803.18,1807.24," So moving on to why this is, to my point."
1807.24,1810.46," So firstly, why this is not, why this plan is not"
1810.46,1812.78, justifiable under the criminal justice system.
1812.78,1815.2," So in the criminal justice system, firstly,"
1815.2,1818.44," we need to see whether this act is illegal or not, right?"
1818.44,1822.14," So in the case of the paying off, payment of ransom,"
1822.14,1824.88, it does not connect to the direct harm to somebody else.
1824.88,1825.76," So like maybe the harm is like, no, maybe the harm is ransom, it does not connect to the direct harm to somebody else. So maybe"
1825.76,1834.16," the harm might occur, but maybe it might not. So in this criminal justice system, the punishment"
1834.16,1841.2," has to be subjective, but in this case, it is extremely subjective. Because even now,"
1841.28,1845.32, there are still cases where ransom is not paid.
1845.52,1848.04," However, these terrorist groups still insist, right?"
1848.32,1854.08," So, for example, in the cases of ISIS, they export oil and they collect the money from that."
1854.08,1859.88, And these kinds of things are the factors and the sources for these terrorist groups.
1860.1,1866.34, So just by stopping this payment of ransom does not lead to the benefits that they want to talk about.
1866.6,1868.64, So we have to combat in other ways.
1868.76,1872.82," And secondly, we have to consider the responsibility of these individuals."
1873.4,1878.4," So the people who paid the ransom had no intention to harm others, right?"
1878.56,1881.12, They solely want to save their families and their loved ones.
1881.12,1889.16, So we cannot just simply say that they are going to be criminalised just because they want to save these people and it is not justifiable because
1889.16,1895.38," criminalising means that the state is actually going to ignore these people's lives, that"
1895.38,1899.4, it's definitely going to be taken away under their paradigm. So moving on to these practical
1899.4,1904.26," benefits, we believe that taking this plan is completely counterproductive and will cause"
1904.26,1906.94, many more innocent people's lives to be deprived.
1907.38,1912.32, So there are going to be two consequences that can be thought.
1912.6,1921.74," So firstly, when we criminalise it, what might happen is that the parties are going to negotiate with the criminal individually and secretly."
1921.96,1926.82," So rather, taking this plan is just going to push this payment of ransom underground."
1927.72,1932.84, So we believe it's a comparative letter in the status quo when the state can actually
1932.84,1938.32, intervene and the state can also negotiate instead of making these families do it.
1938.4,1942.22," And when the families do it individually and secretly, they will have to pay a huge amount"
1942.22,1942.62, of money.
1942.62,1945.62," And rather, this means that much more bigger amounts of money. And rather, this means that, like, huge, much more,"
1945.72,1947.4, huge and bigger amounts of money.
1947.64,1949.52," So rather, this is going to empower terrorists, right?"
1949.72,1953.54," And secondly, we should leave, like, a grant for these,"
1953.78,1955.84," to, like, negotiate and pay."
1955.96,1959.76," Because when we do not, like, we cannot pay"
1959.76,1961.36," making ransom is going to be difficult,"
1961.68,1964.44," these terrorists are not going to be satisfied, right?"
1964.62,1968.48," They are going to be desperate to get more money. So what will happen is that they are going to be yn mynd o gwmpas yna yn anodd, nid yw'r terwyr hyn yn mynd i fod yn ddiolchgais. Maen nhw'n mynd i fod yn ymddygiadol i gael mwy o arian. Felly, beth fydd yn digwydd yw eu bod yn mynd i"
1968.48,1972.24," gydnabu mwy o bobl ac yn mynd i ddynnu mwy o bobl. Ac, er enghraifft, maen nhw'n mynd i"
1972.24,1977.12, dynnu'r deunydd o fewn y terwyr yma o'u grwpiau terwyr ac yn mynd i dynnu
1977.12,1982.4, pobl ddynol ac yn mynd i dynnu'r bani ac ati i gael mwy o arian
1982.4,1988.58," ac i ddynnu eu hunain. Felly, rydym yn credu y bydd hyn yn mynd i ddynnu banks and etc. to get even more money and to empower themselves. And so we believe that this is actually going to kill many, many more innocent people under their pardon."
1989.02,1993.8," So thirdly, we believe that, as we have already told you,"
1994.3,1999.82, it is the state's responsibility that the state cannot seek and protect the safety of its citizens.
2000.22,2005.0," So it is not justifiable to criminalise the act of saving someone, as we have already told you."
2005.0,2010.0," So we believe that the government has to do its best to save these people, and completely ignoring them,"
2010.0,2019.0," and completely just pushing them, saying that it is something that is going to be criminalised, is very detrimental, is very harmful,"
2019.0,2023.0," because it means that the state is going to actively kill someone, right?"
2023.0,2027.02, They are going to ignore this one definite victim that is going to actually happen.
2027.34,2030.4," So, like, for example, even in today, like, when the police is not there,"
2030.48,2035.78," others can try to save someone, even if it causes harm to others."
2035.78,2041.2," So, in this case, it is the state's responsibility to be able to leave a choice,"
2041.32,2048.76, at least leave a choice for these people to pay the ransom and save this one life that is definitely going to be deprived and their paradigm.
2049.24,2054.86," So, concluding my speech, when you consider how many lives are actually going to be taken"
2054.86,2059.02," away, how many innocent people are actually going to be killed, the opposition side has"
2059.02,2067.0," been about the uncertain benefits coming from the government side, so we have to oppose."
2070.0,2073.0, Thank you. Now let's turn over to the leader of the opposition. I'm going to sum up the case here for the next few years.
2078.0,2086.0," The overall connotation coming from the government side is that in order to save mass population, they are going to sacrifice"
2086.0,2087.0, the fine nation.
2087.0,2093.0," That it is possible, that we think it is better, however we think that because there is no"
2093.0,2099.0, mechanism how they are going to de-empower the terrorists and also that we do not believe
2099.0,2106.0," that they actually are going to empower the, and also perfectly prevent terrorism."
2106.0,2115.0," Because they think that by taking this proposal, they are going to sacrifice an individual who is not responsible for being captured by terrorists."
2115.0,2120.0, And also because the government has a responsibility to save these kind of individuals.
2120.0,2127.0," So, firstly, I'm going to point out why the government side does not have any workability to prevent terrorism."
2127.0,2136.0," And secondly, given that, what state should do and what is the responsibility of the state?"
2136.0,2145.1," Firstly, the government has constantly told you, by taking this proposal, they are going to prevent, they are going to protest this"
2145.1,2145.36, report.
2145.64,2149.04," However, we don't think that it is the case."
2149.36,2154.92," Firstly, as I and my partner have constantly told you, because the income of terrorists"
2154.92,2160.44," does not necessarily come from the ransom of the British and Chinese, because they have"
2160.44,2169.0," any way to gain their financial power, such as the exploitation and so on."
2169.0,2175.0," In that case, if you want to do terrorism, what you need is a bomb, a gun, and so on."
2175.0,2182.0," We don't think that they need to gain thousands of money in order to get a gun or a bomb, ladies and gentlemen."
2182.0,2187.0," We think that in those cases, we can understand why in their paradigm they can completely"
2187.0,2193.0," protect the citizens and also why they can justify the sacrifice of citizens, ladies"
2193.0,2194.0, and gentlemen.
2194.0,2197.0," So, secondly, what they should do."
2197.0,2202.0," As I said in the first speeches, though the audience was speaker, there are people who"
2202.0,2207.0," are not responsible for their being captured, for example, spies,"
2207.0,2209.0," soldiers, journalists, and so on."
2209.0,2215.0, These kind of people do not arbitrarily go to these kind of areas to be captured by terrorist
2215.0,2216.0, states and gentlemen.
2216.0,2222.0, Because these kind of people are sometimes forced to go to these kind of dangerous areas
2222.0,2225.0," by government, by companies company and so on."
2225.0,2232.0, Because we think that it is understandable that those people who are going to be interested
2232.0,2236.0, in this kind of area are also selfishly being captured.
2236.0,2240.0," It can be understandable, but there is no notion of that point."
2240.0,2245.0, We think that in the case of those people who are not fully responsible for their own act.
2245.0,2249.0, They believed the government had the responsibility to protect its citizens.
2249.0,2259.0," And also, there is no justification to prohibit or thwart these kind of people by the family or other state, ladies and gentlemen."
2259.0,2268.0," So because we believe that the government has fulfilled feel it's responsibility to protect citizens, that is to say, to ensure the safety of citizens."
2268.0,2274.0, We believe that the government should make an effort to protect citizens.
2274.0,2279.0," And also, as the opposition side constantly told you,"
2279.0,2285.0, because the reason why we have to prosecute the terrorists is to save its citizens.
2285.0,2296.0," However, this government is going to sacrifice its citizens in order to weaken the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen."
2296.0,2305.0," Even in the paradigm of terrorism, it will constantly occur, and also they will not abandon the protection of citizens."
2305.56,2308.74," And also, however, in the paradigm of the abortion side,"
2308.74,2310.56, we are going to protect citizens.
2310.56,2314.56," However, the situation has not slightly changed."
2314.56,2317.58," As my partner has told you,"
2317.58,2319.46," because after taking this proposal,"
2319.46,2321.5," that because family wants to protect,"
2321.5,2323.62," want to stay with their member of the family,"
2323.62,2327.0, they are going to do the negotiation secretly.
2327.0,2333.0, That means to say the payment of ransom will not be also cut.
2333.0,2342.0," And also in that scenario, it is more harmful because we believe that there is no governmental protection in the negotiation."
2342.0,2347.0," And also, the organization cannot supervise the negotiation and also to help the channel to supervise the negotiation in some cases"
2347.0,2351.0, because we are against the proposal
2351.0,2354.0, against the reason we are not interested in the proposal.
2356.0,2358.0, Thank you for your competition.
2358.0,2360.0, Now I will call upon the Prime Minister
2360.0,2415.0, to deliver a speech to the audience here. I'm going to show you the process of making a Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen in this house.
2415.0,2425.0," We want to cut the source and we want to protect the worst of accidents such as more 100,000 or billion people"
2425.24,2428.16, are killed by the gas or bombs.
2428.16,2432.2," So, and, well, after taking this plan,"
2432.2,2437.2," government clearly showed that the citizens and terrorists,"
2437.48,2440.7," their government stance that Namsan is guilty,"
2440.7,2449.0," terrorist groups action won't escalate. As usual, governments remain to give money to terrorists."
2449.0,2451.0, They request a gain-and-gain.
2451.0,2456.0, And we want to stop this occasion.
2456.0,2462.0, And this motion is uniquely and the only way to cut the source of this case.
2462.0,2467.48," Okay, let's move on my summarize. But I want to repeat"
2467.48,2473.48," my previous speaker. I have three repetitions. Firstly, since the family cannot save because"
2473.48,2489.0," they cannot give ransom to terrorists, so it is pity. But it is not true. But as I mentioned in my constructive speech, even if the ransom, they are familiar"
2489.0,2512.68," with the ransom, in the major case, the victim, so we stop this. It's no problem."
2512.68,2528.0," And secondly, she said, we don't say the justification, so I want to give money to terrorists. It is equal to support terrorist acts."
2528.0,2534.0," It is very guilty, even if subjective, but support is very guilty."
2534.0,2546.0," So, it is in the criminal justice system, it should be criminalized, right? And, okay, and sadly,"
2546.0,2548.0," uh,"
2548.0,2550.0, Negotiate?
2550.0,2552.0," Ah, they"
2552.0,2554.0," negotiate secretly, so"
2554.0,2556.0," this is a good point, but"
2556.0,2558.0, we believe that police is not
2558.0,2560.0," so, uh,"
2560.0,2562.0," uh, so, police"
2562.0,2564.0, can intervene
2564.0,2568.94," also secretly, do, and not to know from terrorists."
2569.32,2585.0," They do more secretly and they can, police is good, is specialist. families or not special or nervous people,"
2585.0,2590.0, negotiate secretly is more than our police can do well
2590.0,2595.0, than our individual. So we think
2595.0,2600.0, our sex to police effectively solves the problem.
2600.0,2609.18," OK. I want to summarize this debate. I have two question points. Firstly, which plan can prevent worst case accidents"
2610.78,2613.62, such as one million people die?
2613.62,2614.46, This plan.
2614.46,2619.46," As I told you that in confused situation,"
2620.78,2630.0, people cannot think deeply and they easily to humanitarist.
2630.0,2635.0, So it is not saving victims.
2635.0,2641.0, And opposition says countermeasures but it is no mechanism.
2641.0,2645.0, And they are irrational in public place.
2646.06,2649.1, But I don't know the mechanism.
2649.1,2651.1, So our side is theory.
2651.1,2654.04," And secondly, which is better,"
2654.04,2657.58, protect victims and other member of people.
2658.84,2662.68," Opposition side strongly talk about one people's right,"
2662.68,2663.98, one people's right.
2663.98,2667.44," But our side are mentioned again and again,"
2667.44,2670.66," the major majority people, the life."
2670.66,2675.66," So, this is more important to protect."
2675.82,2680.0, It's the answer is surely the moral people.
2680.0,2682.92," So, from those reasons, our side superior"
2682.92,," to opposition side, Thank you for listening."
