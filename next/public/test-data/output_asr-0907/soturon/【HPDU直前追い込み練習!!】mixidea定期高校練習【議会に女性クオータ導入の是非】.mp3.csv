0.0,6.76,ではですね、前回ね、倉田芽衣さんに来てもらったんですよね。
7.36,14.6,先週の金曜日かな。倉田芽衣さんに来てもらって、フェミニスムジェンダーレクチャーをしたんですけれども、
15.34,19.54,そこに結構来てもらったメンバーが多かったんですが、なんとですね、
20.44,26.34,ちょっと僕もびっくりしたんですけど、その後にやったモーションがね前回言わなかったですけど
26.34,28.92,あんまフェミニスムとジェンダーに
28.92,30.84,あんま関係してないモーションをやってしまうっていう
30.84,33.06,ちょっと謎の事故が起こってしまったんで
33.06,35.02,ちょっとびっくりしましたね
35.02,36.6,なんかプレパの段階で
36.6,39.3,これにしよっかみたいな感じで
39.3,40.94,ノリで選んだんですけどメイと
40.94,43.44,なんかプレパ5分くらいしてから
43.44,46.0,これあんまりフェミニスム
46.0,49.24,とジェンダー関係なくないみたいな これファミリーモーションじゃない
49.24,52.38,どっちかっていうとみたいなっていう ちょっと事故が起こってしまった
52.38,56.4,ね今度こそねちょっとジェンダーフェミニズム モーションやりたいと思います
56.4,65.28,"let's begin the hplu直前練習 the motion this house will introduce female has introduced female quarter empowerment. Without any further ado, let me call upon the Prime Minister."
65.28,67.84, Hear hear.
70.72,86.18, Being able to say one's opinion is a fundamental right which democratic society must ensure and this motion is to to install
86.24,88.24, is the female quarter and
89.12,92.14, install our female opinions to
92.94,94.4, to solve
94.4,99.3, Some issues which are exclusive for females. So let me first
99.92,113.04, Explain our model which are which is 5050. So every voters will select one male candidate and also one female
113.04,130.48, candidate in each selection and the gender is based on one acknowledgement so it's not physical gender necessarily and so with that is our model so now three analysis for status quo
132.08,140.8, uh sorry i don't think so first females are oppressed in many occasions and uh especially
140.8,145.92," uh some issues which are exclusive for females are neglected, ignored in serious schools."
145.92,146.06, Point.
146.7,148.16," Sorry, no, thank you."
148.16,165.88," For example, childcare, because they have an exclusive possibility to raise children, give birth to children,"
166.28,169.44," so there are many harms for, exclusive harms for females,"
169.82,175.28, and males can't understand such harms necessarily.
176.2,177.3," So, no thank you."
177.94,182.86," So there are harms, and our second figure will elaborate on this point."
182.86,189.24, Second analysis is that stereotype is lessening the opportunity to make discourse for women.
189.76,214.54," And it's not an actual true meritocracy in state schools because there are many means which are dominating the many societies, many leaders, and especially in parliament. So, this stereotype is, so, like, there's a stereotype that the females, like, the males,"
215.38,218.86," they're, like, superior to women."
219.14,219.42, Yes.
221.3,222.04, Taken.
222.66,229.44," If your criteria for implementing a quota is oppression and stereotypes, why don't we"
229.44,232.5, introduce quotas for race and ethnic groups?
232.5,242.14," Okay, so as a stance, we think it is totally irrelevant to this motion and it, as like"
242.14,246.38," parliament, it can be installed in another cases that female"
246.38,254.46," quarter is for female issues and if ethnic problems or such things are so serious, it"
254.46,256.62," can be, it can be introduced."
256.62,259.04," And yeah, that's the stance."
259.04,268.56," And so now back to analysis, there is no meritocracy so called in status quo. It's not an actual meritocracy."
268.56,281.8," And the idea that females can't have the inner ability as males is pressing, lessening the opportunity for women to say what they want to say."
282.08,287.38, So the thought analysis is that there is oppression and that is motivating the females to say what they want to say. So the thought analysis is that there is oppression and that is motivating
287.38,293.74," the females to say what they want to say, what they want to change, but instead of school,"
293.74,307.52, they can't say such opinions because there are many people who are unconsciously thinking based on the stereotype and like unconsciously
307.52,317.12," voting to males or like thinking that men are superior to women,"
317.12,324.24," that this motion can change it. So now, by this motion, there will be"
324.24,329.22," female voters and voters will select each candidate, which is men and women."
329.22,345.0," So in state school, there are many people who are choosing who to vote based on their discourses"
345.0,348.1," so they can have a chance to,"
349.24,353.66," firstly, see some opinions from women"
353.66,357.7, and they have motivation and they now have hope
357.7,362.26," to make discourse because instead of school,"
362.26,388.96," they can't, but in the aftermath they will be able, they will feel it's possible to make their discourse and to make a change for the society. realize the democracy because in status quo there are some ideas that the ability of males"
388.96,396.16, and females are not equal and it's not true but still some conservatives and masculine
396.16,405.18, people are still believing that the males are superior to women and it is totally wrong but some people are believing and
405.18,411.6, some and also majority of people are cheated by ideas unconsciously
411.6,420.18, and so that leads to the false democracy that now by female quota the women can't
420.18,430.5, actually have a chance to make their disc or a disc. So it is totally exclusive and which must be done.
430.5,434.5, So now let me explain the exclusivity of this motion.
434.5,437.3, So two things to say.
437.3,441.2, One is why other solutions can't solve.
441.2,447.14, And the second is why this this making quarter can solve. So first
447.14,454.64, why other solutions can't solve. So parliament making quarter is very
454.64,462.04, something special role in society because in parliament those who can be
462.04,465.24," in candidate can make opinion, can have a candidates can make an opinion,"
465.24,470.72," can have a chance to change the society, make the law,"
470.72,474.12, which means changing the society.
474.12,481.76," And so in this social system, those who can't stand in parliament"
481.76,485.94," can't change the society, can't have an ability to change the society."
486.52,491.16," But now, as I explained in our second speaker, we elaborate on this point,"
491.96,497.3," they can't have a chance to, females can't have a chance to change the society in status quo."
497.3,510.72," So, and by this making quarter, some conservatives,�ーwe are like cat will like can do anything so this is exclusive and are so proud to propose"
510.72,515.72,thank you
515.72,518.44,thank you very much えっとすみませんちょっとスピーチ
518.44,523.34,始める前にも言い忘れたんですが hp style にちょっと今回合わせたい
523.34,526.26,のであの mixigen のシステム上7分まで
526.26,527.84,ってなってるんですが
527.84,529.66,ファーストからサードまでは
529.66,532.62,なるべく5分ぐらいまでで終わらせてもらったら
532.62,534.2,5分15秒ぐらいですかね
534.2,536.56,終わらせてもらったら非常にありがたいです
536.56,538.18,ちなみにPMさん
538.18,539.5,大変申し訳ないんですが
539.5,541.1,フェアネスの観点から
541.1,544.18,5分20秒ぐらい過ぎた
544.18,566.0,あたりでちょっとノートテイキングはやめてます今回のディシジョンには反映しないのでコーナーのスピーカー、ヒューヒュー。
580.0,582.0,OK
588.34,589.32,5分ですよねそうです
589.32,592.68,5分15秒とか
592.68,593.64,20秒くらいまでは
593.64,594.6,なんとなく取ります
594.6,596.64,初めて大丈夫ですか
596.64,598.0,ごめんごめん
598.0,599.02,1人ごとしだ
599.02,601.5,5分15秒から20秒くらいまでは
601.5,603.04,ノートテイキングが一応します
603.04,634.54,いつでも初めて大丈夫です。 The reason why I gave race and ethnicity as a reason why we don't implement quotas is because we think the fact that just because a certain group is oppressed and has stereotypes against them is not enough of a just reason to do so.
634.54,644.72," Even if it is enough of a just reason to implement quotas, we say that the harms actually are counterintuitive and counterproductive in the liberalization of these minority groups."
645.0,646.4, I'm very happy to oppose.
646.68,648.5, What is our stance as an opposition?
648.8,654.9, We say our side has a stance of trying to achieve the issue of gender equality
654.9,657.36, throughout measures that are not female quotas.
657.36,660.26, That looks like things like engaging in targeted recruiting
660.26,665.4, and trying to increase the number of women who are capable of entering elections.
665.62,669.82," We're going to promote women applying for jobs which are very male-oriented, such as getting"
669.82,674.5," into STEM fields. We're also going to ensure fair pay and legislative action for paid leave,"
674.56,679.4, for instance. We think that those cases can be done by men and doesn't need a radical change
679.4,686.02," of female quotas, which harms and infringes on the principle of equal opportunity. The reason why this stance"
686.02,691.86," is so important, but also so mutually exclusive on our house, is because our side puts equal"
691.86,696.86," opportunity, the most fundamental case of democracy, which government tried to say their"
696.86,702.54," side was supporting. We say that on our side, we make sure the women with skills can go up the"
702.54,705.04," corporate ladder without any kind of bias,"
709.42,709.7," whereas in their world, they're automatically letting women into powerful positions."
711.5,711.7," As a stance, we support different things,"
715.7,715.9," so if they try to say that all these kind of things can be achieved on the government side,"
719.8,723.48," we say that's going to automatically mean their stance is contradicting, because there's a difference between equal opportunity and affirmative action."
723.86,725.42," With this in mind, two things I want to discuss."
725.72,730.12," First, why this is principally unjust and shouldn't be taken in a democratic nation."
730.44,735.3," And secondly, why their side harms women, the very factor they're trying to protect."
735.98,737.54," Principally, this is unjust."
737.86,742.62," We say that the principle of competition, regardless of elections, is equal opportunity."
742.62,745.1, That is that we should ensure always that the
745.1,749.68, one who deserves something should always get rewarded. Two reasons why. First is because
749.68,757.26," the reason why this is true, even on governmental levels, is because democracy always ensures that"
757.26,762.38," people are able to fight on equal grounds. That's the reason why in many several cases,"
762.56,770.36," regardless of race, for instance, the reason why corporates are able to choose regardless of affirmative action is because they always want the people with the most skills."
770.98,776.9," Two, the reason why we think female quotas infringes upon this principle is two reasons."
777.22,780.52, First is because it puts the unworthy in worthy positions.
780.52,785.54," As a premise, we cannot assume that just because a woman means that they are able"
785.54,789.82," to represent the values of all women. There's going to be women who respect abortions, for"
789.82,796.0," instance, while there's women who don't respect abortion. But even further, the fact is that we"
796.0,800.96, don't think that something determined as a time of birth should be chosen to decide who's going
800.96,810.92," to be the prime minister or some kind of politician in the first place. But secondly, this kind of female quotas is something that absolutely discriminates against men, right?"
811.22,818.18, You're using a variable that's unchangeable at the time of birth to decide who gets to be in powerful corporate structures.
818.4,820.14, We think that principally this is unjust.
820.14,825.2," But thirdly, we say this is bad because it fundamentally attacks the principle of democracy,"
825.2,828.76, which government was trying to say they were protecting. Why? Because you now have to make
828.76,834.2," voters have to choose, magically choose a female, even if they don't agree with their kind of"
834.2,838.2, beliefs. We think the principle of voting should be about voting who you want to choose for. We
838.2,842.88," think that at this point where you have to make voters select one male and one female, for instance,"
843.12,845.26, this goes against this kind of principle
845.26,852.54, of equal opportunity secondly why does this harm women then because we say that stigmatization and
852.54,857.64, oppression is gonna it's gonna continue why is this because in the case of having oppression
857.64,862.26, and stereotypes we think that even if you get these people into the parliament they're still
862.26,869.0," going to be just acted as a tokenization, for instance, right? That they're going to be, these women are going to be treated as if that they were"
869.0,873.8," just getting there without any kind of power, but just for the sake of filling up the number of"
873.8,878.28," females in the parliament. We think of this case, when tokenization is seen in European nations,"
878.28,883.84," like France or Spain, we think that this is already true and that oppression and stereotypes"
883.84,886.52, are not going to disappear disappear you see it's
886.52,891.7, gonna be much worse but secondly we say this harms women because this puts women against only women
891.7,897.26, right we think that the fairness should be that women and men has an equal like ground of fighting
897.26,901.7, against each other making sure who has the most skill are able to be achieved but the problem
901.7,909.32," with this is that you're making women go against women trying to get into the quota, but you're also putting men against men. We think this is unjust."
909.6,914.28, But realize that our side does actually the opposite. We liberalize and reduce stereotypes
914.28,918.98, for two reasons. First is that we reduce stereotypes by making sure that the most
918.98,923.5, capable people are able to go into politicians by ensuring that there won't be any kind of
923.5,929.86," stereotypes or bias inside these kind of elections or even in corporate levels. But secondly, we liberalize"
929.86,934.38," women because we tell them that they're not being chosen just because of women, but we're choosing"
934.38,939.84, them based on their own skill and capability and not a variable determined at the time of birth.
940.04,949.32," We say that our side is much better because we protect the principle of fairness, but also we actually liberalize women, the very factor that government is trying to protect."
949.44,950.16, I'm happy to vote.
956.62,957.64, Thank you very much.
957.64,996.7," Next, let me call upon the Deputy Prime Minister. here和歌さん大丈夫?"
997.88,1006.0,"はいすいません大丈夫です Like, I'm sorry."
1010.0,1012.0, Start!
1012.0,1014.0, What the leader of the opposition came up and told us
1014.0,1016.0," seems to be so equal, seems to be"
1016.0,1018.0," like, um, so fair for all"
1018.0,1020.0," the people in the society. However,"
1020.0,1022.0," it is just, um, however, what"
1022.0,1024.0," he meant doesn't mean, like,"
1024.0,1028.92, they are protecting some specific people who are struggling right now.
1029.32,1048.24," We say it is especially female who are struggling with their childcare, but abandoned from their husband, from the society, including even like a parallel event, right? So in order to solve the most urgent problem right now"
1048.36,1050.32," in the society, we are more than happy"
1050.32,1052.14, to propose this motion.
1052.14,1056.98," So with that said, I would like to do two things"
1056.98,1057.82, in my speech.
1057.82,1060.56," First, making some rebuttals to the previous speaker."
1060.56,1064.64," Second, reinforcing the government cases,"
1064.64,1073.56," mainly about the practical benefits and the exclusivity, I mean, the uniqueness of this motion to take."
1073.84,1087.02, So let me go first with rebuttals to the previous speaker. about like uh like we need to ensure that we we need to ensure that like equal relationship with
1087.02,1094.58, for like between the society and uh like in this motion it is like female like let's say it is like
1094.58,1099.92, give and take relationship but even in the even in the government paradigm that kind of relationship
1099.92,1105.16, still existing right now right because even after taking this motion the female candidates
1105.16,1113.22, have the responsibility to reply to the to what to to the female citizens like to the expectancy
1113.22,1119.26, of the female like a female citizen because there is a female quota those uh those candidates are
1119.26,1137.9, are like elected right so there is a responsibility for these female representatives to do their best to fight against the issue that is existing right now for the female.
1138.28,1146.24," And second, there is also a responsibility for female citizens in general to vote and to make"
1146.24,1147.6, contribution to the society.
1148.22,1148.4, Because
1148.4,1153.1, there is
1153.1,1155.66, expectancy
1155.66,1158.02, from the female quota
1158.02,1159.68, for these citizens
1159.68,1161.78," to do so, it must be"
1161.78,1163.92, an important thing to
1163.92,1174.42," incentivize these female citizens to go voting and to create a better society, not only for men, but also for females."
1174.68,1177.26, So that kind of relation still exists right now.
1177.88,1186.0," So with that said, I'd like to explain first about the practical benefit, how this motion can be a solution to reflect the female citizens opinion"
1186.28,1189.88, so we say this motion can be a solution mainly by
1191.1,1193.66, three analysis first of all the
1195.88,1197.88," First of all, like"
1199.0,1200.9, first the
1200.9,1202.62, female like
1202.62,1203.98, female like
1203.98,1209.2, candidates are a necessity for the diet or for the
1209.2,1215.56, currently. Although our honorable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is highly
1215.56,1219.86," capable to deal with educational or democratic issues, that does not"
1219.86,1226.72, mean they have enough like perspective to uh to care about the like to care about the female uh
1226.72,1233.92, like of like like how these females are in a like serious focus right now right because uh
1234.88,1241.12, because like because actually our prime minister do not have children they cannot they do not they
1241.12,1249.94, cannot like make like make uh sympathetic emotion to uh to mothers to mothers who are struggling with finding a kindergarten
1249.94,1255.76," or who have to do both working and a child care, right?"
1256.02,1288.68," So on that occasion, there is a necessity of women representatives to come up and show the society, to show the diet not set an ideal stage for females to express their"
1288.68,1289.68," opinion, right?"
1289.68,1295.56," Although, yes, there is a social media for women to express a political opinion or how"
1295.56,1317.56," they are struggling under their status quo, but there actually is an oppressing situation that does not make solution for how those female people are in"
1317.56,1351.04, a serious situation. And then we say that this problem is really urgent problem because we have to protect not only women themselves make 100% contribution to the society.
1351.18,1354.92, So it is important to protect these female people in the society.
1355.24,1357.0, We are more than happy to propose.
1360.88,1361.94, Thank you very much.
1362.1,1366.0," Next, let me call upon the deputy leader of opposition."
1374.0,1376.0, Can you hear me?
1376.0,1378.0," Yes, I can hear you."
1384.0,1388.0," Start! Start! First of all, why is there an election?"
1388.0,1417.36, Because the nation can vote and they select the they are the candidate valued to join primary.
1417.74,1420.92, So is it equal opportunity? I don't think so.
1421.1,1423.0, So I will oppose this motion.
1423.46,1427.44," So first of all, I will rebut their argument."
1427.44,1450.48," So this is about stereotype. So however, of course, if there are stereotype, they are stereotype. People and the nation can vote right and voting right and"
1450.48,1465.0," they are vote, they can vote. So it is not a meaning and it is the nation's responsibility."
1465.0,1470.0," And the second attack is, so this is about female law-sharing."
1470.0,1475.0," However, it is not important. So we can't see the necessity"
1475.0,1480.0, about the introduction of this motion.
1480.0,1489.2, So how they can change the condition how females can change the situation and it is
1489.84,1505.0," unclear and well it is we can see the necessity so uh so i will oppose this motion and Next, I will explain my point."
1505.0,1510.0, So my point is about women.
1510.0,1515.0, I will explain about women.
1515.0,1520.0," In the first place, some of the people, some of the female,"
1520.0,1534.1, don't want this motion and so even if I into this motion so some of the case some of the
1534.1,1545.6, burden will be will happen so as the first speaker said like if opportunity over skill like skill so
1545.6,1547.66, and second is like woman's
1547.66,1548.82, point so
1548.82,1551.86, there I will explain
1551.86,1553.78, two types of woman so first
1553.78,1554.62, point is
1554.62,1557.18, first point is
1557.18,1558.54, like
1558.54,1561.58, some of the people
1561.58,1563.84, who don't some of the female
1563.84,1565.1, who don't who don't who don't some of the females who don't
1565.1,1568.02, who don't
1568.02,1570.54, want to do it
1570.54,1572.04, so of course
1572.04,1574.24, some of the females
1574.24,1575.82, will be pleased
1575.82,1576.4, because
1576.4,1579.96, they can
1579.96,1581.6, join our
1581.6,1582.86, empowerment
1582.86,1588.5, they can get liked however some of the people will be
1588.5,1608.48, will some of the people will will be women can join it.
1608.48,1611.82, So it depends on government.
1611.82,1624.36," So if they have a chance, equal or just like election, almost all women don't desire to"
1624.36,1629.32, join because of government's depending.
1629.32,1637.9," So some of the people, almost all people want to appreciate their skill."
1638.16,1642.2," However, they can't appreciate the skill."
1642.76,1649.44, So it is very bad for women.
1649.84,1655.02, Second target is like maternities
1655.02,1659.24, or females who don't desire it.
1659.66,1661.94, So why it is serious?
1661.94,1666.34, Because they have to join without forcing. So it is serious because they have to join they have to join without forcing
1666.34,1671.62, so it is very bad case how government decides the rate or desire to join
1671.62,1678.2, environment is unclear and irresistible so forcing if woman don't hope it and
1678.2,1710.32," after plan so first target like a skillful woman, even if in e-tourism, like a skillful woman who are very skillful, it is not a limit like women, women who are very skillful. Women have to do it, it's impossible. So it is very bad cycle for"
1710.32,1716.5, discuss about to that discuss informant. Second target is like they said about
1716.5,1726.2, women's maturity leap. So they are how will we leap long term. It is bad.
1731.4,1732.12, It is bad and the women's image will be decreased if they live.
1738.6,1741.12, So I will oppose this motion. Thank you.
1790.48,1790.68," Thank you very much. Next, me go up on the opposition, opposition, government here here. We say that today's opposition side has a big failure. They never proved how these situations of women are going to improve in their side."
1797.08,1797.3, So we actually think that our side wins principally and practically because these women are being exploited in the society now.
1798.98,1799.44, We'd like to talk with two things.
1802.18,1802.28," Firstly, we'd like to do some kind of rebuttal to them."
1805.66,1810.16," Secondly, we'd like to compare our points and their points by the principle and practical level all right so firstly we like to do some rebuttals"
1810.16,1816.04, well right well they said some well they say a lot of things well firstly they said that these
1816.04,1822.7, kind of like making some kind of law law for women or like other things can be made by these kind of
1822.7,1827.24, men but we think that but we think that the most important thing
1827.24,1831.14, is that even these people can make these kind of laws for the women.
1831.48,1834.42," Some women are actually suffering from these laws, right?"
1834.54,1838.06," Because it is not their will of having those kind of laws,"
1838.22,1838.76, they're suffering.
1838.96,1841.42," So actually, what we think is that principally,"
1841.7,1847.54, we have to make these kinds of part and parliament as a place that
1847.54,1855.04, each each like woman and the men are also going to discuss their opinion and going to make a better
1855.04,1860.58, society that's actually what we're going to make uh what we want to what we want to make and
1860.58,1875.52," secondly would they point that these kind of like um isn't it good with some kind of like, for example, racial like quotas that we think that, well, firstly, we think that we can also introduce these kind of things."
1875.76,1883.8," But even if it's impossible, we still think that we should introduce these female quotas in the diet."
1884.24,1885.08, Why is it better?
1886.98,1887.12, Because these are racial quotas.
1889.92,1890.24," If we introduce it, what would happen is that we are going to like,"
1894.3,1900.02, we think that we're going to introduce with the proportional population rate. This means that there are like the parties that only have like 1% of the quota of the minority ethnicity.
1900.48,1906.62, We think that these kinds of discrimination will be emphasized in these cases because there's only like 1%
1906.62,1908.38, and nothing will change
1908.38,1910.18, we are going to have more hard times
1910.18,1911.54, and we don't want to make
1911.54,1914.34, these kinds of situations in society
1914.34,1915.7, but in the world
1915.7,1919.12, as a proportionate population
1919.12,1921.24, there are mostly like 50%
1921.24,1923.16, of male and 50% of women
1923.16,1923.98, in society right
1923.98,1926.3, because we say that the democracy
1926.3,1927.06, should be
1927.06,1930.34, like a small nation to discuss
1930.34,1932.62, for equality and make a better society
1932.62,1934.1," without these discriminations,"
1934.48,1936.34, we say that because there are an equal
1936.34,1937.8," number of females and males,"
1938.88,1940.44, we say that we can make a better
1940.44,1942.36," discussion, better"
1942.36,1944.24, policy by doing it.
1944.84,1946.2," Okay, and moreover,"
1947.66,1948.42, they say
1948.42,1949.96," moreover, well,"
1950.1,1952.02, they say that these kinds of
1952.02,1953.52," some people,"
1953.88,1955.6, they also say that
1955.6,1958.16, people should vote for their
1958.16,1959.02, own will
1959.02,1962.2, because it is liberal and we can
1962.2,1964.24," liberate women, but actually"
1964.24,1965.64, we think that the woman is
1965.64,1972.52, being sacrificed today because we because we say that um people usually when when they vote they
1972.52,1978.04, usually see like what kind of experience they have before right if you have like if some people
1978.04,1983.24, politicians are chosen like five times you're going to you have the high possibility to vote
1983.24,1985.8, these people rather than the person who had never done
1985.8,1992.76, these politicians. That is actually why these women are not in politics. Because women have
1992.76,2000.24," not been chosen or been sacrificed or been ignored in these elections, we think that these situations"
2000.24,2005.2," are still existing. And in order to change it, we think that we should give the experiment"
2005.2,2007.6, to these women to change the society.
2008.06,2012.8," Okay, next I'd like to go to our comparison of the principle and practical level."
2012.8,2019.0," Alright, so firstly, we'd like to talk about which can work better for democracy, principally."
2019.4,2024.84," Well, firstly, they said that this kind of democracy should be chosen by who you vote,"
2025.54,2028.34," or like what party are you going to vote, or like that."
2028.44,2030.98," But we think that because, as we told you,"
2031.22,2034.38, that this democracy firstly should be a place
2034.38,2037.9, that you're going to make a better society
2037.9,2043.92," by including the people who are in the country,"
2044.12,2045.14," for example, by using the"
2045.14,2052.68," proportional rate, because we say that each person should have the right to speak out for it."
2052.84,2058.12," That's actually why we think that it's better. Moreover, we think that because women are not"
2058.12,2062.88," being chosen, we say that principally, it is actually being a discrimination for the woman,"
2062.88,2067.04, right? We think that this situation is not being improved.
2067.2,2068.46, We think that it's harmful.
2069.04,2074.56, But this is actually why we think that we won at a principal level.
2074.82,2079.72," However, secondly, we think that we won this debate"
2079.72,2083.82, because we actually told you how we can improve this study practically
2083.82,2090.16," because we say that in today's situation, like child care leave or other situations, it's not improving enough, right?"
2090.34,2097.18," And even you say that something on the SNS, you're going to tell you that you're a feminazi or like a twifemi or ratifemi."
2097.46,2099.8, And you're going to be oppressed.
2099.8,2105.66," Your opinion, if you speak out, that's actually why we say that in order to improve your status"
2105.66,2107.08," of the social status, for example,"
2107.36,2109.8," in companies or other places,"
2110.16,2111.92, we think that we should introduce
2111.92,2113.68, these female quotas because they
2113.68,2115.5, should have better
2115.5,2117.2, size on them. Thank you.
2119.44,2121.38," Thank you very much. Next, let me call up"
2121.38,2122.74," the opposition. Wait, you're here."
2124.08,2124.54, Let's start.
2128.52,2129.16, Please. Start!
2129.74,2134.82," So we want to rise female status and we want equal opportunity, right?"
2135.3,2147.24," However, this motion contradicts for this purpose and this motion is not practical and therefore we are happy to oppose. So in my speech, let me compare between"
2147.24,2155.44," our alternatives or our points and this motion. So from two view, first view is meaning. So"
2155.44,2169.82," government side complains female candidates will be free from stereotype with this motion. However, this motion contradicts from its purpose because"
2169.82,2177.08," this motion itself represents stereotype. In fact, it looks down on women. So, let me"
2177.08,2186.66, explain. All this motion is saying is that women can't be elected with the help of this motion.
2187.58,2194.84," Meaning, after this plan, women are elected not because they're skillful"
2194.84,2213.56," or they deserve to be, but because they're women. So this motion contradicts from its purpose of freeing women from stereotype."
2214.44,2221.1," And also, our point is superior because we ensure equal relationship based on equal ground,"
2221.2,2222.34, as the first speaker said.
2223.04,2227.48," In our world, women can work against not only"
2227.48,2237.12," women, but also all candidates based on skill. And in addition to that, government side concedes"
2237.12,2245.52, that our side is better because they did not refute to this point. So let me move on to the second point.
2245.52,2247.88, Second point is the benefits.
2247.88,2258.06, So government side claims that this motion can tackle current problems on female inequality
2258.06,2262.24, because there will be more female members of the parliament.
2262.24,2269.22," However, this won't work. So let's think why there looks no policy"
2269.22,2276.92," for women in the current situation. So basically, government side misunderstands the current"
2276.92,2289.08, situation. So why there looks less policy for women is because citizens as voters do not prefer such policies so members
2289.08,2295.54, basically members of parliament is elected through equal vote including women or ready family or all
2295.54,2311.38," people right so this is basic of the democracy by the way so because So because people have right to vote equally based on their opinions,"
2311.38,2322.16," this current situation is not because of some stereotype or the problem government claims,"
2322.76,2329.34, but it is because of the opinion of citizens as such.
2329.34,2340.06," So, and also, also, point."
2341.82,2349.9, Taken. taken so if you say that a big the status quo problem is happening due to due to the small
2349.9,2355.36, number of like a female candidate how opposition paradigm can solve that kind of issue
2355.36,2365.96, so you know they so even women or feminists have right to vote and there's equal opportunity for women candidates
2365.96,2366.58, so there's
2366.58,2369.84, if we want
2369.84,2371.98," some policies for women, we can just"
2371.98,2373.86, vote to such
2373.86,2375.94, candidates and also it's not
2375.94,2377.76, just women who
2377.76,2379.82, will have such
2379.82,2381.82, idea or have such policy but
2381.82,2383.88, also men can do so
2383.88,2388.64, so there's no need for this motion and let me move
2389.76,2406.06, let me move on so also um after this motion uh also government assumed that men can't make rational decisions
2406.06,2408.1," about child care, as their"
2408.1,2409.9," second speakers say,"
2410.0,2410.5, I recall.
2412.74,2414.22, This is incorrect
2414.22,2415.44, because men
2415.44,2418.26," also have children, right? And they have"
2418.26,2420.0," siblings and families, so they have"
2420.0,2421.8, more than enough incentive
2421.8,2423.4, to take care of gender issues.
2423.4,2425.86, So their argument is meaningless.
2426.74,2436.56," So at the end of my speech, let me say that even if you take that they resolve female"
2436.56,2442.98," issues, we shouldn't dismantle the principle of equal opportunity as government conceded"
2442.98,2447.0," and as we argued, this is what democracy is all about"
2447.0,2450.0, and we are happy to oppose. Thank you.
2450.0,2477.88," Thank you very much. Next let me call upon the request speaker from opposition. Even if we introduce this plan and the form of equality realized, this is not the radical"
2477.88,2485.16, solving for equality. Women never want this making up numbers. What they needed is support.
2486.88,2490.1, Today's crush point is which is the real democracy.
2490.76,2492.18, We have two crush points.
2492.32,2494.72, And first crush point is which is real democracy.
2495.24,2498.44, And second is which will be better society for the women.
2499.08,2502.02, First about which is real democracy.
2502.54,2505.7, They were saying about the women can say one's opinion
2505.7,2507.22," and also get the seat,"
2507.7,2511.58, and they will be released from oppression.
2512.3,2514.62," And our point was about forced to choose,"
2514.62,2517.62," which means losing the freedom of choice,"
2518.18,2524.08," because every citizen must choose with their real will,"
2524.78,2534.42, and because parliament members represent citizens and politicians who have skills to realize their demands.
2535.04,2536.82, So we have to choose with freedom.
2537.14,2539.98, Choose with freedom is the real democracy.
2540.64,2541.4, So we are superior.
2541.4,2546.0," And about the second crush point, which will be better society for the women"
2546.0,2552.58, they were saying about women's politician knows women's feelings so they can protect their
2552.58,2561.68, problems however uh our point was about uh they were we can't never say that they are uh
2561.68,2567.18, choose by their real abilities and disconnect to their harm because like some
2567.18,2575.6, women don't want to get choose with because of the making up numbers and also like they will
2575.6,2587.78, feel pressure because of their uh the government is uh gives them the seat. Because women don't wish this
2587.78,2591.6, automatic pause and also they are admitting that
2591.6,2595.82," women are weaker and don't have ability in the society, we can't"
2595.82,2598.4, show that their position is weaker in the society.
2601.78,2602.5, Our
2602.5,2610.72, government failed in addressing how incapable women who become yes-men in the
2610.72,2620.02, parliament can throw out policies better than capable men who have incentive in resolving
2620.02,2621.2, gender issues.
2621.2,2627.24," On our side, our stance supports women having the opportunity to fight on equal"
2627.24,2635.5, grounds as men through measures like engaging in targeted recruiting or even not revealing
2635.5,2648.76," genders of politicians, for instance. We reduce stereotypes because they know that women are capable of entering the STEM fields, for instance."
2649.32,2656.48, And we reduce oppression because only the capable who are independent can make changes.
2659.34,2666.38, So who we want to protect is women who want to get admitted by the society with their true skills.
2666.38,2676.34," And we are saying about that we have to realize the equality by supporting them, like, for example, promoting getting jobs and give opportunity."
2679.14,2685.86, And the second point was about it gives the women harm because it's not
2685.86,2688.26, their real ability and they can't
2688.26,2689.7, get out of the pressure.
2690.32,2692.02, So for these
2692.02,2693.42," reasons,"
2693.66,2695.86, we are happy to oppose.
2696.8,2697.64, Thank you.
2699.38,2700.72, Thank you very much.
2700.92,2701.9," Lastly, let me call up"
2701.9,2712.06, the speaker from government side. Here.
2712.62,2713.38, Start.
2717.0,2717.3," Two questions in this debate. Firstly, is taking this motion justified?"
2720.56,2720.98," Secondly, is taking this motion beneficial for women?"
2729.8,2734.36," The second question is more important than the first one because in such urgent situations, as the government has explained, there is no place we may need to care about"
2734.36,2744.3," what they call fairness, which was so unclear. So moving on to the first questions, as we"
2744.3,2748.76," have already responded to the democracy argument, I'll concentrate on fairness."
2748.76,2754.16," As for this point, their idea was that, look, just leaving women and men just the way it"
2754.16,2755.16," is, is fair."
2755.66,2759.42," So let's just encourage them, which is a fair way."
2760.08,2765.84," So then they have to prove that in status quo, women and men are competing in the same ground,"
2765.84,2786.26," which they didn't prove. Because they proved that in the status quo, election is unfair. the whole stereotype is in everyone. And so how people,"
2787.52,2790.86, so how women won't like run for an election.
2790.86,2793.86, So women are not even in that same round.
2793.86,2795.76," So secondly, they said like,"
2797.68,2799.34, that gender cannot be changed.
2799.34,2804.12," So in elections, we can see profiles, names, photos,"
2804.12,2808.44, and all things are stopping people
2808.44,2810.66, from fair judge because they are biased.
2812.14,2815.9, So this beats the analysis on abilities.
2816.38,2821.94," If they say that people who are capable should be elected, then in the status quo, the capable"
2821.94,2825.12, women are not elected.
2831.18,2831.66," So, moving on to the second point, which is taking the promotion of beneficials for women."
2837.26,2837.74," So, women in the status quo are fairly imposed a lot of burden."
2857.24,2857.84," For example, when the government raised consumption tax to 10%, the government didn't raise the tax of daily products, but they did raise the tax of seiryouhin, which is, for women, daily products."
2862.98,2864.24," So why did this happen? Because men couldn't represent the feelings of women, exactly."
2867.26,2867.5," At least on our side, we can solve those kind of problems,"
2868.88,2869.82, which is the serious problems.
2872.26,2872.46," And if they say that after plan is not fair,"
2875.58,2878.82, we still believe that status quo is more unfair because now women are oppressed.
2879.74,2882.34," But in this society, everyone has to be equal."
2882.58,2888.14," So before anything, before everything, people have to be equal."
2888.14,2893.1," That is the premise for everything, including democracy that the opposition side has been"
2893.1,2895.1, talking about.
2895.1,2908.2," Also, we explained how we can solve inequality through exclusively through our point by like giving price to companies that support women"
2908.2,2915.6, so overall they said like in practical though they talk about backlash or stereotype
2915.6,2929.84, but these homes are unclear so are they gonna leave women live unfair lives and just concentrate on backlash or stereotypes and images?
2930.6,2940.36," So we think that at least women might receive backlash, but at least on our side, women can get support from the government."
2940.54,2947.0," They can work, for example, by having her husband get child care leave by the government.政府が子どもの保護を受けたことで、 母親が政府に子どもを保護することができるように、"
2947.0,2951.0,私たちは女性にとって、それが良いと思っています。
2951.0,2955.0,一方、他の側の目標は女性を守ることですが、
2955.0,2963.0,彼らはステレオタイプに集中して、 女性の実際的な要望に集中しなかったので、
2963.0,2986.44,私たちは勝ちました。最初に言いましょうか冒頭言ってジェネラルコメントは特に
2986.44,2987.94,後で時間
2987.94,2989.84,個別リフレイン使うともね
2989.84,2992.62,冒頭言ってRFDにしましょう
2992.62,2993.78,冒頭は
2993.78,2997.46,そこまで差はないんですが
2997.46,2999.22,ポジション
2999.22,2999.82,入れました
2999.82,3002.46,ここまで差もないが
3002.46,3005.16,別にスライドっていうわけでもないですが
3005.16,3008.5,ジャッジによってスライドで
3008.5,3012.04,オポジションに入れる可能性もあるんじゃないですかね
3012.04,3014.1,どうでしょう
3014.1,3017.22,はるかさんとゆうじさんにもまた後で聞いてみてください
3017.22,3018.92,オポジションに入れました
3018.92,3023.88,理由はRFDに入っていくんですが
3023.88,3027.54,シンプルに今回は
3027.54,3031.9,ガバメントの
3031.9,3036.74,APの問題設定としている世界観をわかったと
3036.74,3040.14,実際にどういう風なプロセスを経て
3040.14,3044.86,女性が主に救済されていく世界観になるのか
3044.86,3048.76,というところがちょっと描ききれなくていなかった
3048.76,3050.7,ガバメントに対し
3050.7,3055.02,オポジションはまずイクオリティの観点から
3055.02,3060.0,フィメールにクォーターを与えることって
3060.0,3064.36,ネモクラシーの観点から見ても間違ってるし
3064.36,3068.56,かつプラクティカルコンサクエンセス的に見ても
3068.56,3073.32,フィメールインジェネラルにあまり良い結果にならないよ
3073.32,3075.04,というところを証明できたので
3075.04,3077.12,ポジションに入れましたと
3077.12,3081.02,どういうことを言っているかというのを見ていきますと
3081.02,3084.32,まず1点目はガバメントの係数が
3084.32,3106.18,問題設定としているとからわかったものの、このクォーターでその諸問題を解決するにはちょっと根拠が薄いかなというふうに感じた理由を説明していきますね。おっしゃってくれたのはS級でいろいろな問題があるとどういう風な問題があるかというと
3106.18,3108.06,オプレッションという
3108.06,3109.48,ワーディングだったんですけれども
3109.48,3113.34,実際どういう風な問題が起こっているかというと
3113.34,3114.98,社会全体が
3114.98,3116.7,女性の問題に対して
3116.7,3118.24,ネグレクトしている状態だと
3118.24,3119.38,例えば
3119.38,3121.9,チャイルドケアの
3121.9,3123.34,不十分さであったり
3123.34,3127.56,女性の出産関連のことであったり
3127.56,3130.64,あと子育ての話であったり
3130.64,3133.14,あとちょっと後々のPMリプライから
3133.14,3135.44,ニューエグザンプルだったんですけれども
3135.44,3137.44,生理用品の運分みたいな
3137.44,3139.64,税金のかけ方みたいな
3139.64,3141.68,そういう諸問題がありましたと
3141.68,3144.1,あともう一点が
3144.1,3148.42,女性がアビリティがないよね
3148.42,3151.1,というふうに見下されている状況もSQであると
3151.1,3154.3,なので結果的にどうなっているかというと
3154.3,3156.24,シティズンがアンカウンショスで
3156.24,3162.04,メールキャンディデイにボーティングしやすいような状況になっている
3162.04,3164.66,というふうなことを説明してくれていました
3164.66,3165.96,かなり補足的に説明してくれていました。
3168.04,3169.02,かなり補足的に説明してくれたのは、
3171.92,3172.82,SQのディスカッションフィールドがあんまりワークしていない。
3175.24,3176.72,例えばSNSだと、
3187.74,3191.5,フェミニストというのはちょっとレッテルが張られててかなりディスコースがうまくいってないだからダズンワークというところまでは分かりました
3191.5,3197.26,ここからがちょっとクリティカルになっていくんですが
3197.26,3199.38,まず1点目
3199.38,3205.16,オポジションとのエクスプレシビティをちょっと確認したくて
3205.16,3207.42,オポジションはオポジションで
3207.42,3209.22,ファーストスピーカーのセナ君から
3209.22,3210.16,多分
3210.16,3211.9,全部の
3211.9,3214.84,チャイルドケアでギブバースで
3214.84,3215.72,チャイルドリアリング
3215.72,3217.9,生理用品にサポートします
3217.9,3219.96,っていうパッケージでは言ってなかったものの
3219.96,3221.3,オポジションでも
3221.3,3227.7,別に女性に関する施策っていうのを打っていくよっていうスタンスだったんですね
3227.7,3229.64,どういうところかっていうと
3229.64,3233.52,例えばターゲッティング、リクルーティング
3233.52,3237.66,リクルートが女性のキャンディレートのことか
3237.66,3241.7,女性の職場ではないんでしょうかね
3241.7,3242.9,このコンテストでは
3242.9,3245.44,女性のポリティシャンをなるべくちょっと
3245.44,3246.68,プロモートしていく
3246.68,3250.12,どの辺にあるかわからなかったら
3250.12,3251.86,ちょっと後で背中に聞きますが
3251.86,3254.02,あとこのジョブペイメントの
3254.02,3255.46,イシューとかも男女
3255.46,3257.96,収入のギャップとかですね
3257.96,3259.54,というのも解消していくと
3259.54,3262.2,なので女性の問題in generalは
3262.2,3264.0,割と解決していくよ
3264.0,3266.2,っていうスタンスだったんですね
3266.2,3271.7,かつそれってSQでも不可能なレベルではなくて
3271.7,3274.54,実際にパーラメントでもある程度
3274.54,3277.76,程度はあれど導入しつつある
3277.76,3280.46,されつつあるので
3280.46,3283.7,そのようなスタンスを取ることも正当化されると思っていて
3283.7,3286.36,というところでまず1点目
3286.36,3292.16,ガバメントでしか解決できないユニークな問題
3292.16,3297.42,という問題設定の知りやすさがちょっと薄れてしまったんですね
3297.42,3300.32,このエクスクレシビティの観点でおいて
3300.32,3301.92,2点目
3301.92,3304.64,これもちょっと反論があったんですが
3304.86,3306.66,このような女性の問題
3306.66,3307.9,インジェネラルって
3307.9,3310.24,男性もある程度
3310.24,3312.58,ペイアテンションするインセンティブがある
3312.58,3314.8,あるっていうコンテクストライザーションが
3314.8,3315.5,出てましたと
3315.5,3318.3,例えば子育て世代だと
3318.3,3321.4,もちろん子育ての母親だけじゃなくて
3321.4,3322.8,父親とかも
3322.8,3323.88,もちろんそのような
3323.88,3325.24,興味に沿ったポリティシャンに冒頭するよねっていうところですねチャイルド父親とかももちろんそのような興味に沿った
3325.24,3327.08,ポリティシャンに冒頭するよね
3327.08,3328.36,っていうところですね
3328.36,3329.8,チャイルドケアとかもそうですよね
3329.8,3333.18,ってなった中でS級で女性が選ばれてない
3333.18,3334.04,っていうのは
3334.04,3337.34,いろいろなコンシナレーションがあった中で
3337.34,3339.46,その女性の政治家を選んでない
3339.46,3341.26,っていう状況があるのかな
3341.26,3343.68,っていうところはちょっと理解できたんですよね
3343.68,3347.04,なのでミクロな問題に見たときに
3347.04,3348.48,ちょっと確かに
3348.48,3350.2,そのような問題設定が
3350.2,3352.06,あるのはわかると
3352.06,3353.56,チャイルドケアの施策が
3353.56,3355.36,まだまだ不十分なのはわかるし
3355.36,3358.1,その出産関連の補助金とかの話
3358.1,3358.74,なってくるんですかね
3358.74,3361.74,ケアの話とか子育ての話とかも
3361.74,3364.06,ちょっとまだまだ不十分なのはわかるが
3364.06,3366.64,少なくともオポジションの世界でも
3366.64,3368.76,変わっていくだろう
3368.76,3370.3,もしくはグラジュアリー
3370.3,3371.42,チェンジしていくだろう
3371.42,3372.58,スピードが遅くても
3372.58,3375.06,というところまでの見立ては立てられた
3375.06,3377.26,というのがガバメントの
3377.26,3380.04,ケースの全体の問題設定の話でした
3380.04,3388.6,問題残ったのが2つもうちょっとあって
3388.6,3392.58,ウーマンのアビリティがそもそもないよねって
3392.58,3394.74,見下されてるっていう状況っていうのは
3394.74,3398.02,まだガバメントでもスタンドし得る問題なんですが
3398.02,3400.82,ここはちょっとオポジションの比較になってくるので
3400.82,3402.98,オポジションの話もしますね
3402.98,3407.8,オポジションでもう一応このウーマンのアビリティ
3407.8,3409.46,ブックダウンされるよね
3409.46,3410.82,っていうところのフレームでは
3410.82,3413.3,コンパリソンの軸は共有していて
3413.3,3415.9,オポジションの世界でのウーマンはどうなるか
3415.9,3417.74,っていうと
3417.74,3420.0,そもそも
3420.0,3421.8,ウーマンが
3421.8,3424.0,ウーマンであるっていうだけで
3424.66,3427.2,冒頭されやすくなる世界
3427.2,3430.96,特に50-50ってなってきて
3430.96,3432.12,ちょっとこれはね
3432.12,3435.42,ガバメントのモデルを正確に聞き取れたわけではないんですが
3435.42,3438.1,シティズンって2回冒頭するんですかね
3438.1,3441.58,男性ポリティシャンと女性ポリティシャンに
3441.58,3444.9,冒頭するみたいなモデルだったと思うんですね
3444.9,3446.32,ちょっと聞き間違ルだったと思うんですねで、なかった
3446.32,3448.64,ちょっと聞き間違いだったとしても
3448.64,3449.82,少なくとも
3449.82,3451.54,えっと、まあそうですよね
3451.54,3454.18,女性と男性の比率が50-50になると
3454.18,3457.02,で、必ずしも
3457.02,3460.26,そのクォータのヘルプを得なくても
3460.26,3461.66,当選し得るであろう
3461.66,3462.8,その有能な女性
3462.8,3464.32,スキル不良な女性
3464.32,3466.58,でもないにも関わらず
3466.58,3470.34,女性であるだけで選ばれてしまうコンテクストが
3470.34,3471.7,ポジションである
3471.7,3476.14,そしてそれが結局社会全体に
3476.14,3481.18,女性っていうだけで選ばれたんだろうっていうところで
3481.18,3484.14,そのスキルとかのクライティリアで見ない
3484.14,3485.72,つまり女性を
3485.72,3488.1,ルックダウンしてしまうっていう状況が
3488.1,3490.82,できてしまうっていうところで
3490.82,3493.36,証明してくれましたと
3493.36,3494.78,ここでまず
3494.78,3495.7,この
3495.7,3497.92,SQとAPの
3497.92,3500.24,差でちょっとクラッシュしてるんですね
3500.24,3502.86,どちらも女性ってできてないよね
3502.86,3503.92,っていう社会に
3503.92,3505.3,社会がある
3505.3,3508.94,それが変わるっていうガバメントと
3508.94,3512.0,オポジションはSQで
3512.0,3514.38,ある程度少なくとも
3514.38,3518.52,一部の割合の有能な女性が選ばれてて
3518.52,3523.76,でもAPでもっと全体にルックダウンされてしまう
3523.76,3526.36,っていう女性像が出てきたときに
3526.36,3528.48,ちょっとそっから先の議論
3528.48,3529.74,っていうのがなかったんですね
3529.74,3532.1,どっちの方がより
3532.1,3534.36,ルックダウンの度合いってひどくなるのかとか
3534.36,3536.1,っていうところの
3536.1,3537.94,結論付けっていうのが
3537.94,3539.82,お互いなされていなかったので
3539.82,3542.58,ちょっとこのボーターを
3542.58,3544.66,食らえて入れ寝するのはちょっとしんどかった
3544.66,3548.62,っていうところでガバメントのプロブレムセッティングの2つ
3548.62,3553.84,つまり1点目のネグレジェンスの話は
3553.84,3556.6,オポジションとのエクスクルシビティの観点から
3556.6,3561.32,ちょっとどう変わるのかというのが劇的に見えづらかったというのが1点
3561.32,3565.4,2点目がウーマンのアビリティがルックダウンされている、
3566.06,3569.06,無視されているっていうところの点に関しても、
3569.48,3571.14,オポジションと比べたときに、
3571.2,3573.02,じゃあどれほど良くなるのか、
3573.48,3577.64,良くなるのかっていうところの結論がもう一歩見えてこなかったっていう点で、
3578.08,3581.0,ガバメント全体のケースっていうのがちょっと弱くなってしまいました。
3581.84,3584.5,かつこのAPの世界観で、
3584.8,3585.8,確かに
3585.8,3587.32,More opinion will be
3587.32,3589.44,to some extent reflected
3589.44,3590.8,in parliament
3590.8,3592.32,government parliament
3592.32,3593.42,というところまでは
3593.42,3595.72,証明はしきれたと思うんですね
3595.72,3598.44,じゃあ具体的にどのようなプロセスで
3598.44,3599.64,シティズンが
3599.64,3601.26,チャイルドケアをより
3601.26,3603.28,ベターチャイルドケアをもらえたり
3603.28,3604.98,ベターエンバイラメントで
3604.98,3606.08,ギブバースできたりレイズチルドレもをよりベターチャイルドケアをもらえたりベターエンバイラメントでギブバースできたり
3606.08,3607.72,レイズチルドレンも
3607.72,3610.26,より容易になっていく社会になっていくのか
3610.26,3611.76,っていうところまではちょっとミクロで
3611.76,3613.08,落とせていなかったんですねAP
3613.08,3614.68,っていうところで
3614.68,3617.72,問題設定のエクスプレシビティと
3617.72,3619.3,あとAPで
3619.3,3621.8,ミクロにどのようにシティズンが
3621.8,3623.76,ベネフィットするのか
3623.76,3625.68,っていうところがちょっと見えにくかったっていうのが
3625.68,3627.62,ガバネントのケース全体です
3627.62,3629.46,オポジション
3629.46,3632.0,どこでボートしたのかっていうと
3632.62,3633.7,まず1点目
3633.7,3635.82,女性にとって
3635.82,3640.0,トータルで女性のイメージって
3640.66,3643.16,ルックダウンされるだけじゃなくて
3643.16,3646.24,さらに悪くなるよねっていうところのシナリオが
3646.24,3649.02,一貫して書かれていたっていうのが1点
3649.02,3652.66,あと2点目がデモクラシーにとって
3652.66,3655.72,このイクオリティを無視したプロポーザルって
3655.72,3658.94,アンジャストだよねっていうところは普通に取れました
3658.94,3662.92,どういうところかっていうのを見ていかせていただくんですが
3662.92,3665.3,まず1点目その女性にとって
3665.3,3667.24,女性にとって
3667.24,3669.3,ルックダウンされてしまう
3669.3,3669.96,っていうところで
3669.96,3673.06,そこまでなら確かにガバメントと対
3673.06,3674.56,かもしれないんですけれども
3674.56,3676.4,ちょっと別件で
3676.4,3678.1,SQで
3678.1,3680.3,APですね
3680.3,3683.24,APでどのようなことが起こるかっていうと
3683.98,3688.76,ルックダウンされてしまうとかだけじゃなしに
3688.76,3691.82,実際にもっとバックラッシュが起こるよっていうような
3691.82,3693.58,フリーミングにしてくれたんですね
3693.58,3697.78,つまりSQでフェアに選ばれているのに関わらず
3697.78,3699.66,APってなってくると
3699.66,3702.94,例えばメールポリティシャンにも
3702.94,3704.9,すごいアンフェアな状況になってしまうと
3704.9,3705.46,かつシティシャンにもすごいアンフェアな状況になってしまうと
3705.46,3711.66,かつシティズムも別にウーマンにボートしたくなかったとしても
3711.66,3716.18,選ばれやすい状況が醸成されてしまう
3716.18,3717.58,っていう風になった時に
3717.58,3722.22,別にスキルフルじゃない人も選ばれるようになるわけで
3722.22,3724.3,別にスキル関係なくても
3724.3,3725.9,女性全体の像っていうのを
3725.9,3727.54,ちょっとポジションの中に回すんですね
3727.54,3729.1,ってなった時に
3729.1,3731.9,女性への全体のバックラッシュが起こってしまう
3732.5,3733.64,っていうようなシナリオが
3733.64,3735.12,エローさんから
3735.12,3736.78,完成書いてくれてました
3736.78,3739.34,それが実際に
3739.34,3740.96,フランスとかスペインだった
3740.96,3742.58,何でしたっけ
3742.58,3744.06,トーカナイゼーションか
3744.06,3747.14,絶対覚えてねって書いてあるんですけど
3747.14,3748.32,女性の
3748.32,3750.36,このクォーターのせいで
3750.36,3752.98,クォーターっていうのはトークン悪い
3752.98,3754.06,こいつのせいで
3754.06,3756.8,悪くなった政治が悪くなった
3756.8,3759.02,とかそういう風に言い出すやつからが出てくると
3759.02,3760.22,ってなってくるので
3760.22,3762.36,女性in generalが
3762.36,3763.84,ポジションの方が
3763.84,3765.68,ハームフルな世界になるのかな
3765.68,3767.06,っていうのがすごく
3767.06,3769.9,本能的に分かりましたし
3769.9,3771.24,ロジックも立ってた
3771.24,3772.98,もう一点が
3772.98,3776.0,デモクラシーのプリンシプル的な話なんですが
3776.0,3777.9,ここも
3777.9,3779.58,ガバメントもちょっと
3779.58,3781.74,出そうとしてくれてたんですが
3781.74,3783.42,ポジションの方が
3783.42,3785.92,より強固なロジックが
3785.92,3786.68,組まれていて
3786.68,3789.56,どういうようなことを
3789.56,3791.16,言ってたかというと
3791.16,3793.88,政治の場っていうのは
3793.88,3796.66,能力で選ばれるべきであって
3796.66,3797.86,かつかなり重要な
3797.86,3798.7,ポジションなので
3798.7,3801.58,性別とか外部的要因で
3801.58,3803.14,選ばれるべきではないよね
3803.14,3807.1,例えば会社のポジションとかもそうだよね
3807.1,3810.06,っていう話は本能的に分かりました
3810.06,3813.22,ここでちょっとガバメントからの
3813.22,3815.78,クラッシュなんですが
3815.78,3817.12,まず1点目ですね
3817.12,3821.02,ガバメントのポリティクスの世界の
3821.02,3822.1,プリンシプルっていうのは
3822.1,3824.26,リフレクションオブオピニオンが
3824.26,3827.44,すごく大切っていう風なことで反応してたんですね。
3828.08,3835.68,現状でリフレクションオブオピニオンができてないから、それってデモクロシーとしてどうなの?っていうところの反応がありました。
3836.48,3845.32,まず1点目ですね、ここはちょっとどう取るかっていうのをジャッジによってまちまちなんですが確かにリフレクションオピニオンが
3845.32,3847.76,ある程度大切なのはもちろん分かるんです
3847.76,3849.9,でももう一歩踏み込んだ
3849.9,3851.64,点でじゃあなんで
3851.64,3853.78,この女性の問題に
3853.78,3855.26,関する問題を
3855.26,3857.8,50-50レベルでクォーターに
3857.8,3859.92,落とし込んでまで反映しなければ
3859.92,3861.82,いけないのかっていうところのもう一歩
3861.82,3863.22,踏み込んだ理由付けがちょっと
3863.22,3865.04,オポジションのイコーリティオブデモクラシーにフラッシ踏み込んだ理由付けがちょっとオポジションの
3865.04,3867.82,イコーリティオブデモクラシーに
3867.82,3869.86,クラッシュさせるにはちょっと理由付けが良かった
3869.86,3872.66,っていうところがありますと
3872.66,3875.94,ってなってくるので確かにアサーションレベルでは
3875.94,3879.6,ガバメントの反論っていうのはちょっと聞きそうなんですが
3879.6,3882.98,オポジションっていうのはイコーリティオブデモクラシーを
3882.98,3887.26,ユニークにパーラメントポリティシャンの重要性というところと、
3887.74,3897.66,そのような重要なポストでは、特に男女差というのを気にするデューティーというのはないようにというところを会社とか実績会と結びつけてくれたので、
3897.66,3905.0,そこは負に落ちるので、ちょっとこの反論は取り得づらかったということです。
3906.04,3908.36,というところでサマリーをすると、
3908.66,3911.18,ボーターは3点ですね。
3911.7,3918.66,まず1点目のそのガバメントで押そうとしてくれてた問題設定のエクスクルシビティが、
3919.4,3925.64,ガバメントとオポジションでちょっと差が見えづらかったもしある程度
3925.64,3927.88,ガバメントの方が
3927.88,3929.92,ソルグできやすいような
3929.92,3932.04,状況だったとしたとしても
3932.04,3934.06,まずウーマンのアビリティとかいう
3934.06,3935.06,点に関しては
3935.06,3938.12,オポジションとガバメントでそんなに変わりがない
3938.12,3939.66,オポジションの世界は
3939.66,3941.26,オポジションの世界でウーマンは
3941.26,3942.62,ルックダウンされているし
3942.62,3949.02,もしくはルックダウンよりもさらにバックラッシュが起きてるような世界の方がシリアスだよねっていうところ。
3949.66,3958.44,そしてAPでちょっと女性がどういう風にメネフィットするのかっていう結論がちょっと見えなかった。
3959.7,3962.74,っていうところでトータルでポジションに冒頭しました。
