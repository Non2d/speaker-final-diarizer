0.0,5.0,じゃあ、えっと、不戦勝にはならずということでね、じゃあ、始めていきますね。
5.0,7.0,"OK, let's begin."
7.0,13.0,Motion this house prefers a war where adult children take in their elder parents rather than support them to live separately.
13.0,16.0,"Without any further ado, let me call up the Prime Minister."
16.0,27.4,Here he is.あ、ちなみに僕プレイヤーなんで今日ガチガチでちょっとあれですね
27.4,28.96,ジャッジのではなくなるんで
28.96,31.86,普通に個人リフレとか雑くなるかもしれないです
31.86,32.28,すいません
32.28,33.34,わかりました
33.34,34.02,はいどうぞ
34.02,34.82,いきます
34.82,38.32,スタート
38.32,45.24,"スピーカー elderly of the current status quo are condemned to a life that is not life, where they await"
45.24,51.52, isolation and sadness without a sense of fulfillment until death. We support this motion.
52.18,56.9, Note two things before I begin my sentence. First is that this is not a policy debate. We think this
56.9,62.6," is a comparison of benefits of harms to elderly and both children. But secondly, granted that"
62.6,69.38," opposition might attack the feasibility saying that this is impossible, we say that we characterize adult children as around 35 to 40,"
69.62,73.7," where they have extra income, where they have a stable life. We say this is going to be more than"
73.7,78.1, capable of having parents move in. We say this is going to be better for two reasons. Two
78.1,83.22," substantives in my point. First is upon why this is good for elderly, and secondly, why this is"
83.22,85.58, good for children. Let's talk about our first argument. Why is this good for elderly and secondly why this is good for children. Let's talk about the first
85.58,90.4," argument. Why is this good for elderly? But before I talk about that, let's characterize what the"
90.4,96.4, elderly really need. What they don't need is material consideration because they already have
96.4,101.88, pension fees. They already have money built up from a young age. What they actually need is
101.88,110.56," fulfillment, a care, and emergency responses, especially in the age where you are likely to have more health issues or more mental issues."
110.56,117.22," We think that when they live where their husband or wife might have passed away, they might have Alzheimer's, they're isolated away."
117.46,122.5, We think what these elderly require the most in terms of practical is a sense of fulfillment.
122.84,125.18, And we say our side is able to better prove that
125.18,130.94, before explaining why our world is better two likely cases upon opposition that is first is
130.94,135.84, that under their side they're likely to send elderly to retirement homes the reason why this
135.84,141.36, doesn't provide a sense of fulfillment is because these retirement homes are usually consisted of
141.36,145.02," workers who only care about getting money that That means that if they're fed up,"
149.2,154.62," they're only going to give you the bare minimum. They're not going to care how their day was. But even if these workers were able to provide the sense of fulfillment, we say that they're"
154.62,161.72, less likely and less susceptible to treat any kind of mental or health issues of these parents
161.72,165.78," just because the ratio of these workers to the number of elderly,"
166.1,171.14," especially in this world of aging population and a lack of nursery homes, are proven. That's why we"
171.14,176.22," say that in the retirement homes, this is going to be impossible. But secondly, we say that in the"
176.22,183.34," case, the best case scenario, that we assume that the child can assume and invest and get these"
183.34,185.88, elderly their own house. The reason why this won't
185.88,190.64," work is because these elderly still won't get enough care. That is, the parents don't want to"
190.64,194.74, bother children with their issues. They don't want to care because they already feel bad about getting
194.74,199.08, their own house. They're going to love you and assume you're busy. That's why if you have back
199.08,204.16," pain, you won't tell your children. And at this point, we say that issues are more likely to become"
204.16,209.18," too late to respond to. We think there's going to be a letdown, world in a new turn, possibly even death,"
209.34,215.38," whether injuries or any kind of damage is untreated. With this in mind, why is our world"
215.38,220.2," better? Three reasons. First is because when you live together, you're going to be more comfortable"
220.2,225.42, sharing your issues. You're more likely to talk to these elderly about their days or problems
225.42,230.46, when you live together and see communication over the dinner table for instance but secondly even
230.46,235.7, if there wasn't any kind of direct sense of communication we see that you're physically
235.7,241.16, able to see their kind of issues since you're up close to them so at the point when you see
241.16,245.68," that they're limping or any kind of like coughing extravagantly, we say"
245.68,251.62, that you can send them to hospital and make sure that they're going to be okay at a more urgent
251.62,256.68, pace than opposition side. We say that you're able to provide more affection and love on our side.
257.04,261.76," But thirdly, we say our side is better because distance creates apathy. You see them less,"
262.0,265.2," they become a secondary consideration that when you go there, it's just"
265.2,270.92," going to be a two-hour visit, which was kind of an obligation, right? So on our side, you make sure"
270.92,275.66, that the relationships between the elderly and the child become primary considerations. They care
275.66,281.28, about each other the most. Why do we get better fulfillment? It's two reasons. First is because
281.28,285.42, we say that we provide a sense of fulfillment because the elderly can
285.42,290.22, watch their grandchild raise up or watch their own child be independent and go on with their lives.
290.28,294.34," We say this is going to be much better. But secondly, is that the problem of the status quo"
294.34,299.96, in retirement homes is all the old people do is they just watch TV all day or just play bingo
299.96,304.42, with their elderly friends. This is problematic because this is usually the reason why they don't
304.42,310.08, have any kind of sense of living. This is one of the reasons why many people say like elderly are
310.08,315.7," more likely to feel depressed because they don't do anything productive. On our side, we look for"
315.7,320.96," things for elderly to do, such as interacting with grandchildren on a daily basis, perhaps cooking"
320.96,325.22, or doing any kind of more chores to help out the family. We say that in terms of
325.22,329.9," fulfillment, our side is better. So to weigh this is that elderly people want fulfillment."
331.7,335.82," We provide them, unlike opposition, where because of our likely cases that are analyzed,"
336.12,341.92," this is impossible. Secondly, why is this going to be better for children? Two reasons. First,"
342.12,350.32, is that we open up important opportunities for women or single parents who are unable to afford nannies or cannot afford babysitters.
350.64,354.54, That means that they're not able to take the jobs they want to take. They have to quit jobs.
354.78,359.34, They want to participate because they have to take care of their child and stay at home.
359.78,370.34," At this side, we say that it's much better because women are able to seek help from parents. The parents are staying home and instead of perhaps like affording some kind of stranger or some kind"
370.34,375.34," of shady babysitter, you're able to ask your parents for help to look after your grandchild."
375.46,378.56, We think this is going to be better for both elderly because they could look after their
378.56,382.52," grandchild. You're going to provide seek and affection, but also good for the child themselves"
382.52,385.16, because they can have their own child looked
385.16,391.7, after but secondly is that they won't feel a sense of regret is that we think that in the status quo
391.7,398.4, you these children usually feel regret not feeling um feeling depressed because they weren't able to
398.4,402.84, do what they could have done when their parents might have had an injury at a retirement home
402.84,409.1, when they couldn't find out their injuries during the two-hour visit of an obligation. We think these can often be the
409.1,414.22," stand for suicide or differentiation. For instance, we take care of mental health and prevent any kind"
414.22,420.44," of regret happening. Now, we understand opposition is going to probably come up here with like some"
420.44,430.72, kind of likely case that these parents are going to parents are gonna impose social norms so this isn't gonna be true given uh it's not gonna be good given that they say this three
430.72,436.52, three pre-buttons is first is the parents who are extreme traditionalists will usually do this on
436.52,441.62, both sides and do this from a young age so this point wouldn't be really mutually exclusive but
441.62,445.06, secondly is that this isn't susceptible because since they're
445.06,448.8, parents now we think they will have decent footing with one other it's unlikely that the elderly
448.8,455.02, would just like be super um mean and angry and dominant over adult child but thirdly we think
455.02,459.06, it's better to resolve these conflicting implications by living together so if a child
459.06,463.4, is gay it's better to show that they're gay by living a comfortable life with them instead of
463.4,467.0, just saying that that gay child is fine during a two-hour visit at this point we say our side isゲイを見せるのがいいのではなく、2時間のビジョンでゲイがいいのではないかと言うのではなく、
467.0,469.0,この時点で、私たちの側は良いと思う。
469.0,473.0,両方の側の世界に良いことを見せるための世界だと、私はこの案を決めたい。
475.0,490.62,ありがとうございます。次は、ここに出てくんでスピーチを始めてください。お願いします。
490.62,513.14,はい。 The opposition side think that supporting their parents should be the proper aid.
513.14,517.76, So today we strongly oppose this motion.
517.76,528.56," So first let me explain the model and, I want to explain the why living... Second, I will explain the rebuttal."
528.88,536.74," And third, I want to explain the why living separately is good for the self-actualization for the children."
537.32,541.62," And finally, I want to explain the why also good for the parents."
542.22,549.28," So first, let me explain our model. So in the opposition side,"
552.0,555.24, the opposition side of course think
555.24,560.24, the two care the parents is the very good thing.
561.06,563.28, So we're ugly on this point.
563.28,566.6," However, we think that the to"
566.6,571.16, care thing is the of course good for the parents however it should be the good
571.16,577.56, for it also the children's so there we strongly oppose so and still in our
577.56,584.5, world that even if the children cannot live with the parents we can support we
584.5,586.5," can suppose that their parents it is because parents, we can support their parents."
586.5,589.5, It is because they can't support by the financial.
589.5,603.0," So in the current situation, sometimes the parents cannot have enough money, only the pension."
603.0,609.08," So our side, the children can help by the financial."
609.62,615.84," So, for example, if the parents want to hire a helper,"
616.4,622.96, the children can pay money instead of their parents.
624.06,628.94," And the secondary, even if they live in the same territory,"
629.42,633.9," they can, of course, they can meet once in, for example,"
634.02,635.54, once in one month.
636.42,637.5," No, thank you."
638.3,644.16, So they can also meet even if they are outside.
644.16,648.46," So second, let me attack their point."
648.46,656.38, They said that they could talk and live together.
657.12,663.32, It is not always true because children can't talk if parents have dementia.
663.88,668.3, This puts stress on the children and burdens them.
668.86,673.46, And we explained this point by my second speaker.
673.46,685.9, So let me move on to why living separately is good for self-actualization for the children.
685.9,688.62, So we have the three.
689.76,695.02," So first point, first is if the government side,"
695.6,698.42, they have the restriction of the time
698.42,700.58, because the children want to care
700.58,703.16, and children want to care their parents.
703.32,712.84, So that means they have to fit the parents lifestyle so that I mean is that that means is that
712.84,719.36, the children cannot children cannot enough the working or their hobby
719.36,726.34, because because for example the maybe their children's wake-up time and the parents' wake-up time is different.
727.58,737.78," And, of course, the children, as they worry about the parents, can only meal themselves."
738.18,739.4, So they worry about it.
739.64,743.18, So that means they have to fit their parents' lifestyle.
743.6,747.44, And second point is emotional cost so the the
747.44,754.72, care to care to their parents is a belly hard work so sometimes they cannot um communicate
755.76,769.46," uh not easily so that's connected to the mentors to us and so this is a very bad thing, right? Sorry. And so, and under control, under control, why we can"
769.46,777.98," guarantee freedom for children. So then, however, in an opposition, we don't have any restriction"
777.98,785.98," of the time because we live in the civil age, right? So they can continue to work and they can continue the things"
785.98,788.78," that they want to do, right?"
788.78,790.24," And of course,"
790.58,795.22," the emotional cost is reduced, right?"
795.5,797.54, So that means that they can live
797.54,799.28, clearly in the government side.
799.62,800.42," And as I said,"
800.68,803.64," the two, the opposition side"
803.64,808.72, think that globally is very important side think that um globally aid is very important so that point
808.72,817.6, sorry so um the it is a better than the government side and they're also this uh our opposition side
817.6,830.18, is the good for the um parents because the uh because the sorry the it's uh we think the parents can be independent
830.18,839.22, children keep supporting so to press the in a pleasant situation the uh in a pleasant situation
839.22,845.84, the parents can uh parents is no and in a future so they know in the future
845.84,847.36, so they become old
847.36,849.48, children support them
849.48,852.04, so that means they give up to
852.04,854.08, to become
854.08,855.5, older or
855.5,856.32, to
856.32,859.62, to be low
859.62,861.66, their functions
861.66,863.44, so they don't do effort
863.44,867.06, however in opposition side they're only
867.06,875.04, financial or the remote support so that means that they have to do a they have to do a lot of
875.04,880.74, work or a lot of things even if they become in the old so that they don't give up right so that's
880.74,885.16, to the their function still okay So it is also good.
885.26,891.08," And in addition, maybe their children is very worried about their parents, right?"
891.08,897.98, So what I mean is that sometimes is that parents is too extremely depend on their children.
898.44,908.16," However, I think that as I said, the two training their function is very important so the ours our arguments"
908.16,918.24, want to say that in the uh the opposition side uh can can parents more in more independent so
918.24,928.64, that is also good for the parents so we propose we oppose this motion thank you thank you very much
928.64,968.52, next let me go up and if the Prime Minister here The elderly that we are talking about do not need money they do not need financial aid because they
968.52,973.14, already have financial aid from other things like pension and so on what we think is the most
973.14,977.54, important for these elderly parents to live a fulfilling life is to have like emotional
977.54,983.1, fulfillment to be comfortable in their own homes and be able to do things that they enjoy even in
983.1,986.6, their later lives we think that the sort of emotional support is more important
986.6,990.76," than anything that the opposition can provide,"
990.84,992.06, which is only financial support.
992.06,994.3, And we think that the children are the only actors
994.3,996.24, that can provide this sort of support for the parents.
996.56,998.5, That is why we're very proud to propose this motion.
999.36,1001.56, So three things in my speech.
1001.88,1007.16," First, about which is about the children and whether which is better for the children."
1007.16,1014.42," And second, about whether the elderly need the support from children. And third, about how relationships are bettered under our world."
1014.82,1020.72, So for my my refutations are incorporated into my points. So first about children.
1020.94,1025.02, So opposition gave us mainly like two points. right? They told us that they'll have
1025.02,1029.66," to like, adapt to their parents lifestyles. And that's going to be a burden for the children."
1029.98,1034.66," But two responses, right? First of all, this isn't true. Because like they told, they told us about"
1034.66,1038.84," how like, these children will have to wake up at the same time as their parents and so on. But we"
1038.84,1042.24," don't think that's like, first of all, that we think that's first of all, untrue. You can just"
1042.24,1048.9," wake up at separate times, you can like create like a timetable to figure out how to like fit your schedules together, and so on."
1049.24,1054.32," Right. Now, second of all, like they talked about how like, having parents who have like dementia"
1054.32,1058.84," and so on is going to be like a huge burden. But we think that like, in the case of elderly who"
1058.84,1064.2," have like extreme illnesses, and so on, they will, um, they will obviously have like doctors to look"
1064.2,1066.0, over like their health or their mental health and so on. So we don have like doctors to look over like their health or their mental
1066.0,1069.84, health and so on. So we don't think that that burden is going to be completely on the children.
1070.3,1078.08," Most of their like health problems will be solved by, for example, like obviously they'll have"
1078.08,1083.6, doctors visiting their house or they'll go to like daily checkups and so on. So we think that
1083.6,1085.74, that sort of burden of like checking
1085.74,1091.84, on their health is not is not necessarily all on the children right so we say that like the um so
1091.84,1095.6, we say that that sort of burden is not going to be huge in the first place but second of all they
1095.6,1099.38, told us about like the emotional burden that these children face that they're going to be worrying
1099.38,1103.62, about their parents right but we think that that's going to happen on either side right there these
1103.62,1108.3," children are going to be worried about their parents and on opposition we think that that's going to happen on either side, right? These children are going to be worried about their parents. And on opposition, we say that rather that's worse,"
1108.4,1114.64," because their parents are going to be far away from them, like in a completely different"
1114.64,1118.74," prefecture, for example, in an extreme like rural area where there's no one around them."
1118.94,1122.32, They're going to be extremely worried about their parents' health. They're going to be worried about
1122.32,1127.88," how their parents are letting up in that situation, right? And we think that that, like, burden is much worse. It's much better"
1127.88,1135.26," under our side when they can, like, actually check up on these parents daily. And we think"
1135.26,1140.3," that that, like, worry is going to be, like, less under our side. But we think that even if"
1140.3,1146.0," there's going to be, like, an extreme emotional burden, we think that in the long run, as our"
1146.0,1149.94," first speaker told you, there's going to be less emotional burden on these children, right? Because"
1149.94,1159.86," these children in the long run will be unlikely to like, for example, regret not helping their"
1159.86,1198.32," parents, right? We think that these children like are in depth, indebted to their parents because their parents raised them. But if they leave them in a retirement home or live extremely far away from them, and they become emotionally or physically isolated, and they die as a result, they're going to have this regret for the rest of their lives. We think that that is an emotional burden that they have under their side as well. Sorry, I didn't start my speech. Start. I have three minutes left. So"
1198.32,1205.86," yeah, so in the long run, they're going to be less burdened under our side."
1208.4,1223.72," And furthermore, we think that it's much better for children under our side, because if you live close to them, you're more likely to be able to help them if your parents need help."
1223.88,1229.22," We think that the sort of worry or emotional burden is actually much worse under the opposition. But second of all,"
1229.3,1233.78," let's talk about the elderly, right? Do the elderly actually need the sort of like physical"
1233.78,1239.4, proximity to their children? So basically what opposition told us is that all of like the support
1239.4,1243.5," that the elderly need, it can be done like financially, right? But we don't think this is"
1243.5,1249.6, true. And we told you this from like our very from our very first speaker right financial aid is not what the elderly people
1249.6,1255.04, need or what they want we think that like we think that what they need is emotional fulfillment and
1255.04,1260.78, we think that the only actor that can provide that is with um is are the children because we told you
1260.78,1277.84," from like on the physical level how um it's much easier to, for example, talk about a health issue that you have or something that you're struggling with as a parent to someone that you're comfortable talking to, which is someone that you've lived with all your life, which is someone who you actually trust."
1277.84,1287.08, Right. Whereas if you're talking to like if you're talking to like someone from someone from like a retirement home it's much harder for
1287.08,1294.08, you to speak up about these issues um no thank you um and we also told you about how there's
1294.08,1297.94, going to be emotional fulfillment right if you're left in a retirement home you're going to be like
1297.94,1304.04, spending every day just watching other old people play bingo whereas in under our side these elderly
1304.04,1305.34, can actually see their
1305.34,1309.54, children or their grandchildren grow up and so on and we say that the
1309.54,1314.24, sort of emotional fulfillment is what these people need.
1314.24,1320.4," As we are exactly enjoying right now, the attachment can be gained not"
1320.4,1325.56, offline but also online by Zoom video chatting or skype video chatting
1325.56,1328.7, why this alternative is not good enough
1328.7,1335.26, about how these these elderly parents need the physical help
1335.26,1339.82, in like within like health issues first of all but second of all we also think
1339.82,1343.26, that like this physical proximity is important right because
1343.26,1347.82, if if like we think that it's like extremely unlikely
1347.82,1348.72," that these children,"
1350.1,1352.46," we think that if you live extremely far apart,"
1353.12,1354.06," people are less like,"
1354.34,1357.16, these children are less likely to like check up
1357.16,1360.32, on their parents like over Zoom
1360.32,1363.46, or over like over texts and so on.
1363.48,1368.42," Because first of all, the elderly can't use the electronics"
1368.42,1374.84," as well as the children. But second of all, we think that these children will have to go out"
1374.84,1378.58, of their way to do so. And we think that this sort of physical proximity is important.
1379.9,1386.6," And going on to how relationships are bettered under our world, we think that under opposition's"
1386.6,1391.34," world, if people, if these children and the parents live separately, if they have disagreements,"
1391.4,1396.64," there's a physical barrier, and it's likely that they will stop seeing each other if they"
1396.64,1398.02," have a disagreement, and so on."
1398.02,1402.06," But rather, under government's side, we think that these disagreements can be resolved in"
1402.06,1408.46," that moment, and people will be more likely to be able to resolve them because they have that physical proximity, because they have to do that,"
1408.62,1413.2, because they live inside the same household. And we think that generational differences can also be
1413.2,1418.46," like bridged under our side, because these, the elderly will like, will be less isolated,"
1418.62,1422.8," will be less isolated in like an extremely rural environment. And they'll be able to like,"
1423.26,1426.28, understand these generational differences
1426.28,1431.32, understand maybe learn how to use electronics or like learn these societal norms that have
1431.32,1436.94, changed and so on and we think that overall this relationship between um like these intergenerational
1436.94,1441.48, communication is bettered and the relationship of the children and the parents are bettered
1441.48,1445.56, overall under our side very Very proud to propose.
1446.5,1446.6, Thank you very much.
1448.54,1448.8," Next, let me call up the deputy leader of opposition."
1449.08,1471.0, He here. Start. Start!
1471.0,1487.88," We can support for the elderly, even if we can't live, children can't live together. So, and because children can use"
1487.88,1489.62, out of things like
1489.62,1491.64, IT or SNS
1491.64,1493.48," or money support,"
1493.78,1494.32, and we can
1494.32,1497.6," do it. So, I will pose"
1497.6,1499.1, this motion. And
1499.1,1501.1," first of all, I will"
1501.1,1503.96," devise an argument. Second, I will"
1503.96,1525.8," explain about harm, like living with children's harm and living together with parents. And the second is like"
1525.8,1528.0, changing
1528.0,1530.16, society
1530.16,1534.0, to support
1534.0,1537.92, their
1537.92,1538.84, parents.
1540.2,1542.22," So, first of all, I will rebut their argument."
1542.44,1543.14," So, they said that"
1543.14,1551.94," as as So first of all, I will rebut their argument. So they said that as SaaS speakers told you the point,"
1552.9,1561.52," so they said like emotion support, they can do like emotion support."
1561.7,1568.24," However, it is no uniqueness because we can use like"
1568.24,1591.12, IT and SNS we can do video covering and we can do even if they can't they can't live together. And so I will explain about children's harm
1591.12,1598.32, to live together with parents.
1599.02,1600.06," So as far as people,"
1600.32,1604.7," sorry, as far as people talk about time management"
1604.7,1610.56, and children will be tired and it is very serious point.
1610.82,1627.12, So I will support this argument. must have to take care of their parents.
1627.12,1656.58," Like, their age is like 20s or 30s and so on. However, if we now prefer this world, children can work more and more."
1657.04,1665.82," They can live free from pressure. However, if we prefer this word,"
1667.12,1669.66, children have to...
1669.66,1675.9, If the parents' support
1675.9,1678.54," is very become burden,"
1679.26,1681.76, the children have to
1681.76,1689.9, quiet their work because it is very serious physical or mental burden.
1690.36,1692.5, So why is it very serious?
1692.5,1697.86," Because if the children feel very burdened,"
1698.04,1710.68," if they feel burdened, they can't contact the outside because it is the"
1710.68,1718.24, family's problem so it will lead to suicide so it is very serious point and
1718.24,1728.92, and on the other hand our argument is very superior because helpers or helpers is very
1728.92,1737.0, good because they are very specialist and they can have a long-term experience and they
1737.0,1741.34, can be best case support.
1741.34,1749.84," For example, male nutrition or they can do exercise with the elder. So"
1751.36,1770.62, it is very good for because the elder's body can retain good and their lifestyle can be retained mainly because the professional can support it.
1771.34,1788.58, And their benefit is like physical safety for the elderly. because elderly sometimes suffer because of appropriate care
1788.58,1791.78, and even
1791.78,1796.36, sometimes it's boring. So it is very serious for
1796.36,1800.48, elderly and it is very serious for
1800.48,1804.56, children and parents because they will be tired more and
1804.56,1805.56, more.
1811.78,1812.66, And the second is society's change.
1817.92,1818.08, So why this motion is happening?
1821.74,1822.08, Because it is a family's norm.
1825.5,1828.56," So it is a very, like families' norm, because this tendency is"
1828.56,1830.1, very serious for society
1830.1,1831.94, because
1831.94,1833.26," first,"
1834.02,1836.02, we can't
1836.02,1838.02, we can't
1838.02,1839.82, we can't
1839.82,1841.8, spend money
1841.8,1843.98, for social security
1843.98,1847.32, security for example
1847.32,1851.48, for example a housing home and so on
1851.48,1855.7, governments can't
1855.7,1859.16, don't have to need to
1859.16,1862.48, support money because
1862.48,1870.08, governments will tend the children. So it is really a
1870.08,1891.28," burden for children. However, if we support them to live separately, we can solve the burden problem and children can support uh support and society will"
1891.84,1916.0, can support uh to live uh to leave uh that elderly so so if if the children are get married子どもが結婚すると、生きることが難しくなるので、この申請を避けるために、私はこの申請を避けることになります。ありがとうございます。
1920.0,1922.0,ありがとうございます。次に、政府に呼びます。
1927.0,1929.0,聞こえますか?
1929.0,1958.44,"はい、大丈夫です。 When our family moved to Chile, we gave our grandma an iPad so she can have FaceTime with"
1958.44,1960.38, us while we're living abroad.
1960.38,1966.42, But my grandma managed to set an unknown password on her iPad and she locked herself out.
1966.52,1974.6, So then now we have an iPad in our house that hasn't been open for five years or more because she chose this unknown password that she can't figure out.
1974.78,1981.64," So basically, my point here is that just saying that we can do stuff online sounds simple, but it's not simple for the elderly, right?"
1981.96,1985.06," Elderly people are simply no offense, but they're not really"
1985.06,1989.92, used to electronics. It's really hard for them to suddenly have this kind of device that allows
1989.92,1995.08, them to communicate with people online. There's a lot of difficulties that face them from like
1995.08,2000.3, making a simple account or like even getting the internet. Because especially where in rural areas
2000.3,2009.72," where elderly live in secluded areas that are away from the city, they don't even bother to have an internet or like a wi-fi router, right? So I think it's very infeasible when they say that,"
2009.82,2014.62," oh, we can just do this online, right? But more importantly, we say that even if they do get this"
2014.62,2019.52," kind of communication via screen, it's still not enough, right? Like, of course, I enjoy debating"
2019.52,2024.12," online, but I rather prefer doing it in person. The same goes for like taking care of people,"
2024.22,2029.12," right? We think that the elderly doesn't just need to like see their child's faces, right? There's lots of"
2029.12,2035.12," other needs that can only be fulfilled by them living together. Basically, we say that the"
2035.12,2040.8," elderly are first of all very lonely because maybe their spouses died like decades ago,"
2040.92,2045.08, or maybe they're living in really rural areas that have like a decreasing population
2045.08,2051.02, they just need someone to constantly be by their side but more importantly a lot of elderly have
2051.02,2055.58, like have like diseases like both physically and mentally that like prevent them from living
2055.58,2060.5, healthily on their own this can be like alzheimer's right like if you have alzheimer's there's a
2060.5,2068.72, there's always a danger that you can wander away from your house not be able to come back or you can't remember what you wanted to buy for your groceries or these kind of things
2068.72,2073.6, are like daily like disturbances in order for you to live a comfortable life but more importantly
2073.6,2078.82, if you become if you become physically weak in the process it's really hard for you to even go
2078.82,2083.5, to the supermarket if especially if you have to drive for example because you're in rural areas
2083.5,2086.04," or like it's really hard to walk around the house as well because maybe if you have to drive, for example, because you're in rural areas. Or it's really hard to walk around the house as well."
2086.22,2093.54," Because maybe if you have stairs or maybe if you have a really long hallway, it's really hard for you without the support of someone beside you."
2093.76,2100.06," So firstly, we see that these kind of physical and mental issues are significantly serious."
2100.54,2104.2, And that can never be solved on the opposition side where they only have the internet.
2104.48,2110.3," But secondly, why can't it be like helpers right so opposition so far has been talking about things like financial"
2110.3,2115.56, aid or like getting helpers etc or like just sending them to daycare whatsoever but we still
2115.56,2121.08, think this is very bad for the elderly first of all there is not enough daycare nor helpers
2121.08,2125.56, especially in a lot of developed countries like Japan there's so many population of
2125.56,2131.22, the elderly and so many few working class people that like the simple ratio isn't enough to fulfill
2131.22,2135.64, the demand for like these kind of like taking care of the elderly so I don't think not like
2135.64,2140.94, not all elderly would be able to get a helper or be able to get into like a quality daycare but
2140.94,2145.26," more importantly a lot of elderly don't want to go to daycare in the first place,"
2145.44,2149.78, especially if they have to leave the neighborhood or the community or the house that they've been
2149.78,2154.92," for decades and decades. It's really stressful for them to leave stuff behind, right? And more"
2154.92,2159.6," importantly, a lot of elderly, once they do go into daycare, they're going to be spending their"
2159.6,2165.66," whole day watching TV, playing bingo, doing meaningless stuff and with this like poor facility and little"
2165.66,2170.88, entertainment and small community that that overall leads to their stress which also leads
2170.88,2175.02, to like the shortening of their lives and like a lack of quality of life that we can never support
2175.02,2179.38, that is why we still say that these kind of financial support provided to the elderly
2179.38,2183.8, is still not enough then on the other hand what we see uniquely from government side
2183.8,2189.12, is things like physical help and physical comfort and like direct communication between the child and the parent.
2189.4,2194.08, This kind of intimacy and this kind of physical proximity is what we can uniquely achieve on
2194.08,2198.04, side government and the reason why you should vote for gov. But then let's look at what they
2198.04,2202.5," themselves talk about in their arguments, right? So firstly, this whole issue about children getting"
2202.5,2208.5, a lot of stress because like they have to with their grandparents or their parents' lives and so on.
2208.7,2212.5," But we negate the very premise that they wouldn't be able to coexist, right?"
2212.74,2221.22," Let's say a working mother and their high school daughter have really different lifestyles and maybe have different times to wake up, but they still live together, right?"
2221.22,2228.64, We think that just because you wake up at different times doesn't mean that you're incapable to live together. I think it's very possible for these two members
2228.64,2233.44," to live happily in the house. But even if, maybe they might say, oh, if they're together all the"
2233.44,2237.8," time, it might lead to like a huge burden, etc. You don't have to always be together, right? The"
2237.8,2242.46, unique thing about side government is that you're always in a close distance so that you can check
2242.46,2248.36," on them when you have to, or like when you need need to but that doesn't mean that you're always going to be standing over them and watching their"
2248.36,2252.86, every move right you could always have like different rooms for example or you have like a
2252.86,2257.66, lot of like nisutaijuu that they were like in the first floor there's the the one the first generation
2257.66,2261.86, and the second floor there's the grandparents that can also there can lock there can be lots of
2261.86,2265.64, flexible lifestyles within that one house where like people can live
2265.64,2271.06, both independently but where people can also reach out when they actually do need help but um so
2271.06,2276.68, overall we think that like the possibility of this a huge emotional cost or like huge disturbance to
2276.68,2281.76, their lifestyle is pretty low also considering the fact that today we have a lot of things like
2281.76,2289.92, like paid leave or like companies supporting their workers to leave their job in order to support their parents I think it's very feasible for the child
2289.92,2294.74, to live healthily even when they're when they have to take care of parents but secondly they
2294.74,2299.3, talk about how like elderly becomes like overly dependent on the child and therefore like it
2299.3,2305.6," becomes like easy for them to give up etc right. Right? Two responses. Firstly, like, just because they're"
2305.6,2311.34," dependent doesn't mean that it's something bad, right? We think that it's the elderly deserve to"
2311.34,2315.24," get a bit more attention than they do now, considering the fact that they have a lot of"
2315.24,2319.64, mental and physical needs that they can't cope by their own. So I think it's okay for them to
2319.64,2325.16," depend on their child for like groceries, or depend on their child for like groceries or depend on their child for things like like mental"
2325.16,2330.14, communication or like daily chats and we think that like the will to live and the will to survive
2330.14,2333.76, and keep fighting wouldn't decrease outside government because you're always together with
2333.76,2338.12, your family your son or your daughter or your grandchildren being with your family together
2338.12,2343.28, is your motivation to keep living right on the comparative when we see old people dying off
2343.28,2348.98," because they're so lonely in the off-site opposition's world, we think that there's a higher possibility that elderly"
2348.98,2352.74, becomes more motivated to keep living and they wouldn't give up inside government's
2352.74,2352.88, world.
2353.16,2357.38," So secondly, our second response is that in the end, it's comparatively better than what"
2357.38,2361.44," we see in off-site opposition, where a lot of elderly people do not get the resources"
2361.44,2365.84," they need, do not get the mental support, the attention they need, and they ultimately die off either from lack of mental support or lack of physical support.人々は、必要な資金や、心理支援、役割を必要にしていない、そして、最後に死ぬ。"
2365.84,2370.04,心理支援や、体力支援を必要にしていない。
2370.04,2374.24,全体的に、外国人と子どもの、
2374.24,2375.76,共に住んで、一緒に住んで、
2375.76,2376.8,共に支援して、
2376.8,2378.84,幸せな生活を持っている、
2378.84,2379.92,この理由を、私は、
2379.92,2427.0,"この案を提案することに、とても誇りに思います。 Very proud to propose.スタート! Okay, so here we go."
2427.0,2429.0, Start!
2429.0,2434.0," The characterization of elderly people are, to some extent, too much soft."
2434.0,2440.0," The reason why I know this is because I have teacher's license of junior high school and high school,"
2440.0,2448.08," and I visited the real nursery center, and I know the real situation how elderly looks like as exactly"
2448.08,2455.4, they characterize some people have Alzheimer's those who have Alzheimer's really need immediate
2455.4,2462.22, dependence right now immediately for those people I don't think it's appropriate and realistic
2462.22,2466.16, characterization that those Alzheimer's or those kind of the
2466.16,2474.24," elderly people are capable of taking care of their grandson. It is very too, you know, unrealistic."
2474.24,2480.72," Rather we think those Alzheimer's or elderly people are oftentimes, sometimes not, you know,"
2480.72,2486.94," sometimes very getting angry or, you know, shouting around at midnight and they start"
2486.94,2493.22," walking around midnight, they have to find it. Those excessive burden is too much. And we think"
2493.22,2500.1, there is no justification suggested by government side why this kind of excessive care must be
2500.1,2507.68," necessary, except for sending them to the center or helper and why it should be done by children."
2507.68,2513.18, This kind of justification is still not heard any at the last of debate except for the material
2513.18,2518.52, benefit of the spiritual or psychological happiness for parents and I don't think that's
2518.52,2520.72, not good enough reason.
2520.72,2522.24, Two crush points I found.
2522.24,2524.56," First of all, which is better for children?"
2524.56,2527.88," Last, which is better for elderly people? Very simple."
2527.88,2531.08," Moving on, first of all, which is better for children?"
2531.08,2536.28," So, we're saying is that in order to self-actualize for their children fully,"
2536.28,2541.0," in terms of the free from any pressurization to choose whatever the job they want,"
2541.0,2545.12," whatever the partner they want to stay with, whatever the hobby they like to do,"
2545.12,2551.6," or the place to live, whatever. This kind of the situation to live with parent is very narrowing"
2551.6,2559.36," down their entire choice. And they somehow rebutted to some something. Number one, in terms"
2559.36,2565.76," of the you know benefit for their children as well. Like I say, they can sometimes take care of their son,"
2565.76,2573.28," granddaughter, or please kick out this kind of, you know, very dependent, independent"
2573.28,2579.04," elderly characterization should be kicked out of this debate. Rather, those elderly people are"
2579.04,2585.0, psychologically weak or those really need health care immediately.
2585.0,2588.64, That's why they are not capable of doing that.
2588.64,2596.6," And also, in order to take care of those grandson or granddaughter, still we think relying on"
2596.6,2602.96," style party system such as babysitter, nursery center is much superior in comparison because"
2602.96,2606.32," they have child care knowledge based on theory,"
2606.32,2612.44," for example appropriate amount of food, education, or emergency medicine, etc."
2612.44,2617.5," On the other hand, those elderly people don't follow that theory."
2617.5,2622.82," That's why we think at least when it comes to take the criteria of the child caring,"
2622.82,2627.28, still third party system is superior rather than rely on these
2627.28,2633.72, elderly people and also the icon from other rebuttal is that sense of regret is happening
2633.72,2639.54, that's why in order to prevent that they have to stay with parents i don't think so because first
2639.54,2646.28," of all so even right now i sometimes visit their grandparents' house, a parent's house,"
2646.44,2647.96, quarter basis in a year.
2648.42,2654.72," And for example, I'm going to visit them in golden week and sometimes Obon and before end of year."
2655.28,2659.8," And that's, I think, very good enough to see them, how they are doing."
2660.2,2661.6, And that is very good enough.
2662.26,2667.74," And also, so sense of regret is anyway happening in both side"
2667.74,2674.1, of the house because sense of regret is coming from the sense uh coming the fact that people
2674.1,2680.34, have already passed away right just because you guys are staying together does not necessarily
2680.34,2686.84, mean sense of regret to death is suddenly disappear i don't think uh the in terms
2686.84,2692.34, of the amount of the sense of regret there is no much difference confirmed still on the other point
2692.34,2698.56, let me flip entire argument of the sense of the emotional points we are saying mika-san greatly
2698.56,2705.0, explained rather in terms of a sense of psychology. So staying together is worse off.
2705.0,2705.84, Why is that?
2705.84,2708.52," Because like I say, as an introduction,"
2708.52,2713.52," taking care of those parents is very much burden, right?"
2714.0,2717.44, So they're sometimes shouting around midnight.
2717.44,2720.82, They sometimes walk around street at midnight.
2720.82,2722.3, They have to find it.
2722.3,2723.38, It's too much.
2723.38,2726.28, That's why sometimes it's called kaigo tsukare
2726.28,2732.22, right you know that they sometimes got depression they sometimes got even suicide or they there's
2732.22,2737.88, terrible consequences happening that's why in terms of the you know benefit of the sense of
2737.88,2747.94, regret it's much uncertain and rather we think the psychological cost is going to take too much. That's why don't rely on an affirmative argument.
2747.94,2753.44," That's why in terms of self-actualization for children, this point clearly stands."
2753.44,2758.76," They can choose whatever the job, they can stay with the partner or family relationship,"
2758.76,2760.94, whatever the form they like.
2760.94,2762.96, They don't have to change the place to live.
2762.96,2769.96," They don't need to go the place to live. They don't need to go to the suburb area suddenly. That's why in terms of the self-actualization, I also took the"
2769.96,2788.0," debate. Moving on to the parents issue, right? So in terms of the parents issue, well, okay,これが問題です。あれ、ちょっと読み取れておいた。皆さん、えーと、これか。すみません。"
2788.0,2791.0,OK、私は2つの規定を見ています。
2791.0,2793.0,まず、安全性。
2793.0,2795.0,二つ目は、彼らの精神的な面で。
2795.0,2797.0,まず、安全性。
2797.0,2801.0,私たちは、この話題に対するスペアリリティを提案しています。
2801.0,2803.0,安全性、
2803.0,2806.54,薬の対応、科学的なアプローチ、 to this debate right in terms of safety in terms of medication or scientific approach
2806.54,2813.56, relying on the center or helper is much superior to those children because they have enough
2813.56,2819.08, knowledge or they have enough you know they are already professioned based on the nutritious food
2819.08,2829.24," based on the what amount of exercise is appropriate to give, and human interaction and so forth. They suggested that, first of all, there is no centre available."
2829.24,2835.68," Okay, by relying on the norm, children better to stay with parent, because of relying this"
2835.68,2838.76," norm, unfortunately centre is in shortage."
2838.76,2846.36, Rather believe in our side that children should stay away from parents by relieving our pardon rather
2846.36,2851.46, we can have the consensus to send the money to the child care center and the
2851.46,2856.44, elder care center and helper that's why in order to amount of the center this
2856.44,2862.12, problem is already solved and also emotion right so I understand to some
2862.12,2869.08," extent granted right but still like I say the Kaigotsukare issue because of depression, suicide,"
2869.58,2873.14," because of that, sometimes they even neglect to take care of them."
2873.46,2877.14," Sometimes they start bullying their parents in order to prevent,"
2877.14,2882.18," rather we think, appropriate amount of separation is necessary for those reasons."
2882.54,2888.84, Proud to propose.
2889.68,2891.52," Thank you very much. Next, let me call upon the reply speaker"
2891.52,2921.08," from opposition here. Now, adult children are limited and they are just people who are overwhelmed."
2921.08,2926.38, So we need to give them more freedom and for also parents becoming more independent.
2926.74,2929.08, So we are happy to oppose.
2929.54,2938.48," First of all, their government side, it is no necessity for all because first about the communication,"
2938.98,2946.4, like why only they need to like communicate with why the family is the most important because uh this just increased
2946.4,2953.68, the possibility to not communicate with other because the uh the pair the uh the parents only
2953.68,2961.96, just dependent depend to the adult children and the uh the people around them so uh so if we like
2961.96,2969.76, make them more uh depend depend independent independent and like communicate with more other people
2969.76,2976.3, this is like more good for their communication right so it is no necessity and about the
2976.3,2986.1," grandchildren like if they like take care of the if the adult children take care to their parents,"
2986.38,2991.22," those adult children can't even have time to care for their children, right?"
2991.46,2995.14," And also, third, about the emotional support."
2996.48,2998.74, Is it necessary to live together?
2998.74,3005.8, Because they were saying that they can't use this electronic thing and so on.
3005.86,3009.36," But however, they can still use their cell phones, right?"
3009.66,3013.06," So it is like, okay, we can't talk to them"
3013.06,3016.2, and we can't know their conditions and so on.
3016.2,3021.04," And also, as our speaker said,"
3021.22,3026.36," they have neglect and those things, bullying and those things it is this"
3026.36,3036.08, really emotional support so to like prevent this situation uh we it is no necessity and uh about
3036.08,3041.6, their health problems like they can't they were really like talking about like their they can't
3041.6,3046.84," go to the helper and those things but But however, as our second speaker said,"
3046.98,3048.3, we can change the norm.
3048.48,3050.12," So if we change the social norm,"
3050.76,3054.6, those governments will try to support more helpers
3054.6,3055.2, and those things.
3055.2,3060.28, So we can also solve these communication problems too.
3060.96,3063.64," But however, our point, we have high necessity"
3063.64,3066.86, because first they the adult
3066.86,3073.04, children have no freedom and uh they were saying that like they can they're living to each other
3073.04,3080.52, so like they can uh do timetables and so on but however uh they first of all they live to each
3080.52,3087.32, other so the adult children have to make up time it is certain so but time is very important
3087.32,3095.04, for everyone right so it is uh it's not good to intervene their time and also second about the
3095.04,3107.5, emotional cost uh it if it's the if their parent is serious disease they have they will definitely become tired to support so it is more good to use professional
3107.5,3113.9, helper because they know really about it so it's not tired so it is very necessary
3113.9,3121.2, and uh they were like talking they were saying that it is peace but uh but support is not peace
3121.2,3127.58," right because if they are like happy uh they are happy, those suicides together don't happen"
3127.58,3130.58, and those depressions don't happen.
3131.3,3133.78," But because their target is people,"
3134.82,3138.28, their parents can't even go to the supermarket
3138.28,3139.06, and they even move.
3139.44,3141.82," And it means that they're a heavy condition, right?"
3141.84,3144.68, So we have to give big support to them.
3144.68,3145.0," So they were like easy, right? So we have to give big support to them."
3148.36,3148.74," So they were like easy, some months and those things."
3151.26,3152.9, And adult children will certainly worry a lot and always think about parents.
3152.9,3156.92, So they can't concentrate to their working and so on.
3157.1,3159.3, And that's why it's better to rely on helpers.
3159.4,3161.28, At least mental burden will become less.
3161.7,3163.36, So people need time.
3163.54,3170.64, So every people have rights to live more freely. So we are happy to oppose. Thank you.bouvet もう1本ですそう キーボーンにいっぱいのそれをやんエビピーポハブライスでもうフリーリー ソウルやハピとポーズんっ
3170.64,3175.92,前もらったスペースのブラウスピック ファンがあった
3183.2,3187.74,あスピッ�が止まってます
3187.74,3190.44,はいOKです
3190.44,3194.46,はい今回はスピーチちゃんと始めます
3194.46,3195.22,すいませんでした
3195.22,3214.88,スタート start the elderly many of the elderly in the city school die from loneliness they're unable to go to
3214.88,3218.62, like the supermarkets because there's the supermarket they live in extreme rural areas
3218.62,3223.3, where the supermarkets are like 50 miles away right we think that the elderly suffer from this
3223.3,3229.94," kind of emotional and physical burden of being like away from, being away from their family, being away from people"
3229.94,3234.76," they're comfortable with, right? We think that this sort of physical and emotional support is"
3234.76,3239.46, something that can only come from living in close proximity with their family. And we see that that
3239.46,3248.04," sort of support is what the elderly need the most, right? And so we think that this debate mainly came down"
3248.04,3251.84, to the question of which has more benefits
3251.84,3253.78, for the elderly and the children.
3254.18,3255.14, So two clash points.
3255.32,3256.64," First, which is better for the elderly"
3256.64,3258.3," and two, which is better for the children."
3258.72,3259.84," First, on the elderly,"
3260.14,3261.74, we think that opposition overall
3261.74,3263.4, gave us not much of an explanation
3263.4,3272.84," of how their side is comparatively better than our side in terms of giving a better life for the elderly, right?"
3272.92,3278.5, They only told us a couple of alternatives about how they can also provide these benefits under their side.
3278.88,3280.18," Mainly, they told us two things, right?"
3280.22,3282.54," First, they told us that financial aid is enough."
3282.78,3306.5," But as we told you from the very first speaker, financial aid isn't what the elderly need. We say that what the elderly need is physical help, like going to the supermarket to get groceries that they need, or being able to walk around the house, being able to talk to someone about their health issues and so on and second they told us about like um online um second they told us about"
3306.5,3312.62, like how we can like hiring helpers and so on right but we told you we told you that like date
3312.62,3316.94, first of all that daycare and like those helpers are lacking especially within like an asian
3316.94,3322.68, population like in japan right but second of all we also said that there are unique benefits that
3322.68,3329.96, come from the the children and the family of the family members of the elderly helping them because they're more comfortable in that situation.
3329.96,3332.5, They're more comfortable talking about their health issues.
3332.86,3340.34," And also, they're able to physically help within their own household, like help them around the house, help them get down the stairs, and so on, right?"
3341.44,3346.74," And third of all, they talked about how an online environment is is possible and so on but"
3346.74,3351.74, we've we've told you that like these elderly are first of all not very good at like using these
3351.74,3355.92, technologies in the first place but second of all we say that like seeing your children's
3356.82,3361.72, children's face like once a year isn't enough for these elderly so what have we told you under
3361.72,3369.22, government we've told you that that first of all they need physical help right they can't drive to the supermarket because it's so far away or they have
3369.22,3375.54, um they have health issues that like um that keep them from like getting around properly around the
3375.54,3380.66, house and so on and we think that the sort of physical help is uniquely like is uniquely
3380.66,3389.88," achieved under our side because you're able to live under the same roof, which means that you can help them around the house or help them get the necessities that they"
3389.88,3393.44," need and so on. But second of all, we also told you about how there's emotional help, right?"
3393.74,3398.14," You're able to live in a comfortable environment with people that you care about, with people that"
3398.14,3402.0," care about you, and you're more likely to talk about your health issues and so on. And we think"
3402.0,3407.86," that that's a unique benefit that comes under our side that cannot be achieved under opposition. But second of all, let's talk about the children."
3408.28,3412.38," Opposition told us that, like, there's going to be this sort of extreme dependency, right? But"
3412.38,3416.1," first of all, we don't see, like, why that's necessarily bad, right? Because the children"
3416.1,3421.98, were also taken care of by their parents when they're younger. And we think that we don't see
3421.98,3425.3," why they shouldn't be doing that once they become older, right?"
3425.64,3431.68," We think that because these children were dependent on their parents when they were older,"
3431.76,3434.4," we think that these children are justified in,"
3434.58,3438.26, these parents are justified in depending on their children in later life.
3438.26,3440.94," But second of all, all the cases that they talked about,"
3441.72,3445.9," like, although like the whip speaker brought up most of them,"
3446.18,3450.56," which is pretty late, but we think that those are mostly extreme cases, right? Rather, we've told"
3450.56,3454.76," you that three things that are, like, three benefits of the children, right? First, that"
3454.76,3458.7," they'll be able to take care of their grandchildren, and second, that the sort of, they won't have this"
3458.7,3463.48," sort of regret, right? And they told us that, like, that's not going to happen, but we didn't see why,"
3463.56,3469.44," because we think that this regret comes from being unable to save them or help them when they need it, when they"
3469.44,3474.04," need it the most, if they live far away. And we think that that regret will rather better under"
3474.04,3478.68, our side. And we've also told you that the relationship between the generations also
3478.68,3484.62," become better under our side, no response on that point. So we think that overall, the elderly will"
3484.62,3486.0, be saved by this close proximity to their children. And we think that the children can alsoその点については反応しません。全体的に、子どもたちに近くで保護されるように、
3486.0,3490.0,子どもたちとの親子関係も良くなるように、
3490.0,3493.0,私たちはこの案を考えています。
3493.0,3496.0,ありがとうございます。
3496.0,3498.0,リフレクション。
3498.0,3504.0,いやー、お疲れ様です。
