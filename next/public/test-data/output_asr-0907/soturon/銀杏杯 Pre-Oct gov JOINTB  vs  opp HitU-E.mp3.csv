57.0,73.0," So, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and it's a great honor for me to be here and the recognition speech in here. So today I have three, I have two, really three points today."
73.0,85.0," One is that, sorry I have one today that is about the choice for the children. and the two friends, and as Pogo goes to my point,"
85.9,89.9," then he defines the emotion, so the two friends"
89.9,91.98," means that a very little treatment, for example,"
91.98,94.46, the low grade of their elementary school
94.46,96.96," or kindergarten student, and so on, or just for young."
100.96,104.06," So, and this medical treatment is a very"
104.06,110.0," suspected medical treatment. If we deny this treatment, babies will die."
110.0,115.0," So, let me move on to my point about children's choice."
115.0,128.0," So, fundamentally, we have the right to choose our life. So the religion of where to live, where to be born and so on."
128.0,134.0," So these kind of religious issues about our life, we have the right to decide them."
134.0,151.0," However, actually, these young children are so immature. They cannot understand how siblings can adapt for each choice. So instead of them, parents can choose their choice."
151.0,156.0," However, on this point, the most important thing is that"
156.0,162.0," what parents can choose is limited, only reversible choice."
162.0,166.94," Because even though at that point,"
166.94,169.5, children are immature and cannot understand
169.5,173.18," how they can get their choices,"
173.18,177.1, but after they grow up and understand
177.1,179.96," the importance of their choices,"
179.96,182.9, they should have the right to lead to
182.9,184.52, this kind of choices.
184.52,187.52, Because the life of the children is
191.44,193.76, for the children themselves.
193.76,194.6," So,"
204.28,210.0, if the choice by the parents should be only temporary and liberal rule.
210.0,216.0," However, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, it is a well suspected problem."
216.0,230.0," Because if we deny the medical treatment, the children's chance to be a choice will be forever lost."
230.0,235.0, It means that children cannot be a choice in the future.
235.0,247.0," So, if we are declining the very fundamental and important rights relevant to our life from the children."
247.0,252.0, So it is very problematic.
252.0,273.0," So in the first place, why we should have the right to choose about us? Because the most effective after to understand our own love is never to say we are all."
273.0,279.0, I can understand my favorite but I cannot understand your favorite like this.
279.0,292.0," We cannot understand completely each other. So in order to be happy, in order to most enjoy our choice, we should buy ourselves."
292.0,305.24," And also we government should admit this life, because children is also the important individual in this nation."
307.28,309.78," And actually at this point, children is a very"
309.78,311.78, emotional existence.
311.78,314.0, And the opposition has been set down because they are
314.0,316.76," an emotional, the parents have the right to choose"
316.76,317.6, what has them.
317.6,322.6," However, ladies and gentlemen, please remind this point."
322.96,328.0, So this emotional change will grow up in the future
328.6,330.88," and be a very strong existence,"
330.88,334.92, very intelligent existence.
334.92,337.88," They can, they have the potential,"
337.88,340.54, potentially have the ability to choose.
340.54,411.0," And this potential choice means that we decline the right to choose from the individual. So then why this choice is so important? I give an example like this. For example, we get names from the parents and it is very relevant to our or we suffer from this name, we can change it if we become the adult."
411.0,416.0, It is also one of the potential rights that admitted to the children.
419.0,429.0, Religion is pain. Because actually religion is very important part that contains each individual's life.
429.0,433.0, So it has totally changed each individual's life.
433.0,439.0," Maybe it brings children to be happy, however it sometimes causes unhappy."
439.0,455.0," So children should have the right to choose religion however in the future, when they understand what religion is, how severe, how important, how good, how vicious the religion is."
455.0,464.0," So, disliking that potential and important right from the children should not be admitted by the government."
464.0,467.54," So, we are happy to close this motion. Thank you."
473.54,474.96, Thank you for the presentation.
474.96,552.0, I now call upon the leader of the Supreme Court to deliver your case for the 17th. Gracias. 1 tbs of olive oil Thank you Mr. Aman's pizza and the Today I want to protest children living in religious communities.
552.0,565.0, Religion is very important for believers. their identity and their living community.
566.88,571.4, And keep religious teaching and law is very important
571.4,576.4, because they can devote to the good
581.72,589.0, by keeping religious law and they can live comfortably in society and mentally.
589.0,609.0," And we strongly believe that children are immature, so parents can make more better decisions for children."
609.0,620.0," Not only the aspect of medical care, but also living the children's life."
620.0,638.0," So I have two arguments. Firstly, in a state of war, such believers have a choice"
638.0,645.0, to decide which military care should be taken.
645.06,647.0, And this is very good for them.
647.0,649.92," And secondly, after making this plan,"
651.54,655.8, they cannot decide to do medical care
655.8,660.8, and they suffer from the fear of guilty
661.7,663.66, and they can't make a living
663.66,667.0, in the religious society and co-calibrate.
667.0,677.0, Let's move on to my...
677.0,682.0, Sorry. Let's move on to the first argument.
682.0,705.0," And the definition to the government side is included in my argument. very good for them, and they are good for children,"
705.0,711.0, because parents love their children very much.
711.0,720.0," So they can, and parents are very familiar with the religion,"
720.0,728.0, so they know how serious situation they are in.
728.0,731.0," If they broke, they returned good."
731.0,773.0," And parents also know how serious situation a children is in, illness or injury. So they can decide which is more important for children's future. So parents can make a decision, make a best decision for children. And comparing"
773.0,816.0," the doctors, and of course parents want to save children's lives, so they make an effort to touch another medical care, which is live up so it is okay to deny medical treatment to their children"
816.0,847.0," although they are just grown. So let's move on to my second argument. So, after taking this from, parents cannot decide their children and their families because"
847.0,872.0, and because broke religious rule is very serious problem for them They go to the god for a long time to keep the religious rules.
872.0,877.0, So they feel the guiltiness.
877.0,879.0, Not that much.
879.0,888.0, They feel guiltiness and they feel they will be betrayed.
888.0,910.5," So they feel very guilty and it is very miserable life for them. And religious community is very, very important for them. And relationship"
910.5,925.0," is very, very strong very bad for us."
926.2,931.2," And they, they try, and they come to ignore them,"
931.6,936.6," or they make no, they don't make them to go to church"
939.84,941.18, and so on.
941.18,945.0," So they, so they are coming and living."
945.0,955.0," If children are rescued by medical care, however, they are going to live very, very hard lives."
955.0,960.0," So, and it's very serious problem."
960.0,1054.0," So we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you. Grazie. Takk for ating med. The building is a small building with a large entrance. Thank you. This position says that even children will not change their religion, as if parents have the right to decide the children's religion in all their children's lives."
1054.0,1063.0," But it's not true. Parents do not have the right to choose the children's religion forever, just temporary religion."
1063.0,1069.0, So children have the possibility to change their religion.
1069.0,1086.5," So, firstly, let me introduce my previous speaker. Firstly, she said that religious people will feel guilty because of the medical treatment."
1086.5,1091.0, But it's not true because religious people can justify for the medical care.
1091.0,1095.5," They will think if the children have the medical care,"
1095.5,1101.0, government forced us to take the medical treatment.
1101.0,1104.5, So we are not against our religion.
1104.5,1107.0, So they can justify their medical treatment.
1107.0,1117.0, The other people in the community of this religion will not think so badly of this.
1117.0,1127.84," Also, she said about the possibility of children's brain, but if the children are brain by the other student"
1127.84,1132.84," or some children, government can, or school can save them."
1133.72,1138.72," For example, the brain children will ask the school teacher"
1138.88,1142.24," of other religion, and in regard to the community"
1142.24,1146.0," of the religion, so teacher will think it is a problem,"
1146.0,1155.0," and can segregate the children from the community temporarily,"
1155.0,1159.0, and can move to solve the problem.
1159.0,1185.0," Even if there is a possibility of feeling guilty or feeling, but it is not more important than the children's forever right to choose their religion, change their religion."
1185.0,1192.0," If children are killed in the little,"
1192.0,1196.0, children will lose their right forever.
1196.0,1206.0, So we government must protect children's right to choose the right. Thank you.
1209.0,1211.0," And second, she said parents can decide what parents love."
1211.0,1214.0, Parents love their children and understand them.
1214.0,1216.0, But it's not true.
1217.0,1222.0," We, human beings, know about ourselves,"
1222.0,1224.0, mostly us.
1224.0,1229.0," So we must decide about ourselves, mostly us, so we must decide about ourselves."
1229.0,1234.0," So, this is one of the arguments."
1234.0,1239.0, Why is it so bad that children do not have body autonomy?
1239.0,1245.0," As my partner, Mary, told you, little children are immature in this consensus."
1245.0,1252.0," So to some extent, and to a reversible extent, parents can decide, depending on their very little,"
1252.0,1257.0," for example, name, what they wear, and so on."
1257.0,1260.0, Because it is reversible in the future.
1260.0,1271.0, But this is irreversible. We cannot bring them back. So children will lose their right to choose their religion forever.
1271.0,1273.0, So why is it so bad?
1277.0,1280.0, I think it is a consensus that religion is important.
1280.0,1290.0, Religion is a very fundamental part of our life. But the opposition side only considers the parental religious issues.
1290.0,1301.0, But children are also affected by religion greatly.
1301.0,1308.0," The way of thinking, the children's way of thinking might be different"
1308.0,1317.0, from the religion's thinking. They can change the religion when they grow up. So religion
1317.0,1326.0," is important. So parents' right to, sorry, children's right to choose their religion must be given to children."
1326.0,1333.0," Because unless we decide things ourselves, we cannot be happy."
1333.0,1337.0," What is happy for me, I am the best."
1337.0,1357.0," If we don't have the choice, we cannot live freely as I like. It is very unhappy thing. Children will die just as parents may not."
1357.0,1365.0," Children is not slave, children is not doll, children is not means of parental religion.子どもは親の信仰の意味ではありません。"
1365.0,1368.0,子どもは自分の信仰を選ぶことができるのです。
1368.0,1385.0,子どもは親の信仰を信じないことができるのです。 Only living for local is not absolutely valuable.
1385.0,1387.0," Because, for example, there are..."
1387.0,1391.0," In general, it's acceptable."
1391.0,1397.0, So we don't believe that only living is not absolutely valuable.
1397.0,1401.0," I'm going to say, I don't talk about only living."
1401.0,1410.0," Living has a possibility to change your life. Without living, we cannot change our way of"
1410.0,1445.0," thinking, we cannot change our religion. So if we's be compared of the importance, I mean, we can solve the problem."
1445.8,1448.82, But this is irreversible.
1448.82,1451.6, My partner and I have talked again and again.
1451.6,1453.04, We cannot bring the dead back.
1453.04,1457.18," So, life has a possibility, living has a possibility"
1457.18,1458.76, to change our way of thinking.
1458.76,1463.3," So, we must take this right to choose our life."
1463.3,1613.5," Thank you for listening.この光が私たちの生命を選ぶことを願っています。聞いてください。おやすみなさいはい Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we recognize this debate is about which rights are more prioritized, child's rights or be prioritized for these children."
1613.5,1629.0," So why we can say so? I have a thing. So in my speech, I want to add to Mary's three points. First, why do people believe in religion and belong to the community"
1629.0,1655.0," across? For these people, believing in religion is so important in terms of their lives. And how serious is this children after recovering from the death and sadly comparing the both"
1655.0,1668.0," sides in terms of children in the future. So before moving on to the first, I'm going to let me repeat what the government said."
1668.0,1686.3," The government said that children cannot change their religion. But this is not true. So, firstly, the dogma is very different from other religions."
1686.3,1692.8," So, they cannot easily change their religion."
1692.8,1713.5," And also, these children live in this community when they were born and they are taking religious education"
1713.5,1769.32," so most of these children believe in this region. So, considering this fact, even if the situation is not relevant to the religious cases, of course, our side parents allow the doctors"
1769.98,1771.6, otherwise to end the treatment.
1771.6,1774.9," So this way, if this,"
1777.58,1778.4," if this,"
1779.86,1783.38," structure against religion,"
1783.38,1784.7," these parents,"
1793.0,1807.5, these parents and other doctors conflict with each other's statement. So the possibility of the government side cases are so small. So please let me move into the first argument.
1807.5,1809.2," Why for these people, sorry,"
1809.2,1813.2," believe in the religion and belong to the community,"
1813.2,1816.28, believing religion is so important in terms of their life?
1816.28,1819.72, Because only the religion is only after
1819.72,1822.12, to give them mental stability.
1822.12,1822.96," So,"
1825.1,1833.26," if they believe,いやーアメリカたべきそう一方いっでいいいいいいピッポー ストーリーでいっでおめでとうま"
1833.26,1838.76,ウィキャンていらー いいです a サベッキーのアフター
1838.76,1872.16,"そう 方へバーでも、私たちに悪い状況が起こったら、私たちは死んで、その信仰が生きることを信じられる。 Sorry, sorry, sorry. But on the other hand, if they don't obey these documents, they feel they can be saved by these gods."
1872.16,1913.0," So that is very mental harm. Why? Because in the future, they will despair their future. For example, the people in poverty are suffering from this poverty because they have no food and no clothing.例えば、彼らは友人や友人の友人から離れていることを知っています。"
1913.0,1928.0,しかし、この人々は、トグマに対して罪を犯しています。 They feel that if they...
1929.0,1930.0, Lost the top. Sorry.
1931.0,1933.0, Forever we can be saved.
1933.0,1935.0, So no way to help the saint.
1935.0,1942.0, So in the first case they keep the saint.
1942.0,1943.0, They keep the saint.
1943.0,1946.0, But so we strongly with this believing
1946.0,1951.0, and this is so important and how seriousness will be occurred in this motion.
1951.0,1959.0," So as my partner said, the mentoring, the community, sorry, these children isolate,"
1959.0,1969.2," will be isolated from this community because they, the community because the community member ignored their children because they feel that"
1969.2,1980.4," the children betray their dogma. So if these children go to the school, other children"
1980.4,2015.0, don't talk about it with them. And also the children can't go to the church because they are afraid of criticizing themselves. so pity and at last they feel that I was okay that I would die in that situation.
2015.0,2093.0," So for this reason, in some way, for this reason, thank you for listening. Thank you. I'm going to make a Thank you, Mr. and Madam Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen in this house."
2093.0,2112.0, I would like to compare which side is more better for born in the religious community. So I have two cross points.
2112.0,2128.24," Firstly, the parents have a right to decide children's medical care, especially the child is very, very young."
2128.24,2132.6," So, and secondly, and I would like to compare"
2132.6,2134.26, the problem in the state of school
2134.26,2139.26, and the outcome of the after taking this motion.
2140.82,2144.5," So, firstly, the government said that"
2149.68,2165.0," if the children die, they have no right forever and they have no possibility forever. However, this is a very small case because because, as the government has said,"
2167.66,2171.56," children are immature, so they cannot judge"
2171.56,2176.56, which is more better for their whole life.
2178.56,2183.56," However, parents know about very just very much"
2189.0,2205.0, and parents love the children very much and parents love the children very much. Parents can judge the is more better for children's future.
2205.0,2232.0," And if whether children take medical care which is more religious or giving up medical care, which is bad for the religious."
2232.0,2245.0, And they take another medical care and they live comfortably in their life in the religious community.
2245.0,2250.0, And so on and so on.
2250.0,2262.0, And the government far said that they are possible to change the religious.
2262.0,2269.0, This is unrealistic because there are three reasons.
2269.0,2277.0," Firstly, they take religious education at a very, very small age from parents."
2277.0,2289.0," So they are influenced by the religious thought very much. So, and secondly, they grow up in the religious community to some extent."
2289.0,2308.0," They can make a living by themselves. So, at that time, and so it is very bad for children's lives during that time."
2308.0,2317.0, So let's move on to my second comparison.
2317.0,2337.0," And after taking this class, for me, a very, very, very harmful in terms of mentality and living in a religious community because they feel very guilty."
2340.0,2347.0, So we strongly oppose this motion.
2349.0,2353.0, The issue of the motion is final. So I call on the committee to try to summarize this and determine its meaning.
2353.0,2401.0," I call on the committee. Gå in på gulvet. So today, opposition is mainly focused on the people, the people who will certainly follow that religion."
2401.0,2409.06," But ladies and gentlemen, please remind me that that they are both children, to follow and not follow."
2409.06,2413.06, And we also want to protect non-follow children.
2414.82,2419.32," And also, it is very important in the children group,"
2419.32,2422.78," in the child group, in the child group,"
2435.0,2445.0," and also, we want to think that as long as we are living, we can deal with something, use something that we have the possibility to change the situation. However, we did, we are in that, we did, we suddenly lost that. All possibilities. We have no possibility to challenge this situation."
2445.0,2447.0, It's observable.
2447.0,2449.0, And also they are misunderstanding.
2449.0,2453.0," So we just want to prolong your life, but this is not true."
2453.0,2456.0, We want to protect future life of children.
2456.0,2458.0, So let's get into my question and answer point.
2458.0,2461.0, So our question point is one.
2461.0,2463.0, So parents are wise.
2463.0,2468.0, Can it decide children's whole life? The answer is no.
2468.0,2486.0, So we want to take the children's life in this that we want to let that the child is to be admitted.
2486.0,2490.0," In the child's world, the two problems occur as I said."
2490.0,2496.0, One is that two women will follow that religion and two not follow the religion.
2496.0,2514.0, We do not clarify in the child's world in that situation parents cannot decide that never reverse choice because it will
2514.0,2526.0," certainly raise the opportunity to re-choose, it means that we construct our own life for children."
2526.0,2532.0," However, they explain that the parents can decide it."
2532.0,2549.0, Because after the children follow the religion.
2549.0,2555.0, They completely forget that children who won't feed follow the religion.
2555.0,2560.0," And also, as I said, as long as we are living, we can change the situation."
2560.0,2564.0," We have the possibility. However, we feed death. No."
2564.0,2569.0," It's very significant. So on this point,"
2569.0,2580.0," on this point, that significance is that we can spell it out, spell it out in a position"
2580.0,2588.0," in front of the significance of possibility. Also also, they never explained that in that situation,"
2588.64,2593.64, why parents can choose such a severe decision

2599.0,2601.4," So there's no explanation,"
2601.4,2604.8, so why we cannot understand this point
2604.8,2609.0, so that the one they say is very vague.
